**Abstract**


While digital play installations for outdoor use are becoming more
common, little work has been done on how such technology shapes
play in nature-rich environments. We performed a study of chil­
dren’s self-directed play with access to nature as well as digital
installations. Our findings show that play with nature materials
and digital installations emerged in different ways. Most notably,
imaginative play was observed emerging in close interaction with
nature, while the digital installations mostly inspired rule-based
play. Furthermore, engagement with digital installations typically
involved an active exploration phase which was not observed with
nature materials. Nature materials instead engaged the children’s
senses more immediately, and often offered opportunities for collec­
tion and consumption, paving way for fluent play activities roaming
large areas. We argue that these differences motivate rethinking
the design of digital installations for play in nature and suggest
guidelines to this purpose.

**1** **Introduction**


Recently, we have seen a move within Human-Computer Interac­
tion (HCI) towards exploring ways to support children’s outdoor
play, sometimes with the idea of enriching their nature experiences.
Several reasons underlie the trend; in particular, the global trend of
children being less and less active outdoors [ 82 ] despite the ben­
efits of outdoor play on children’s physiological well-being, joy
and learning. Environmental psychology increasingly supports the
idea that having access to nature [1] in play settings is beneficial for
children’s psychological, physiological and cognitive development

[ 14, 52, 79 ]. Clayton et al. [ 15 ] further highlight how the increased
marginalization of nature experiences in all ages has deleterious
consequences for people’s emotional, attitudinal, and behavioural
relations to nature and biodiversity, issues that inspire explorations
into Nature HCI [ 31 ]. Empirical research indicates that children’s
early experiences of being in nature helps foster a positive and nur­
turing affinity to nature in adults [ 13 ]. Cumbo and Pedersen [ 18 ]
propose that this is a particularly important opportunity for digital
technology in nature settings, “ _to_ _support_ _the_ _child-directed_ _nature-_
_play_ _experiences_ _known_ _to_ _instill_ _a_ _value_ _for_ _nature_ _and_ _motivate_
_environmental_ _stewardship_ _later_ _in_ _life”._

Research on digital support for children’s play in nature has pre­
dominantly focussed on finding ways to make digital technology
relevant for enriching children’s play in nature-rich settings. For ex­
ample, a design workshop with children [ 19 ] explored motivations
for outdoor play and how these could be supported by digital play
tools, uncovering motivations such as placemaking, connecting to
living creatures, and challenging oneself in explorative experiences.
A design ethnography [ 80 ] came further in uncovering the rich
palette of play that emerges in nature, and emphasised the social
and bricolage nature of outdoor play, suggesting the design of play
technology that can be used together with materials found in the
space. At the same time, environmental psychology research has

landscape formations.

uncovered how children ́s play evolves in relation to the flowing
terrain [ 53, 54 ], and is characterised by flux and transformation

[ 50, 79 ] in how children tend to engage in swift and playful move­
ments [ 42 ]. These aspects have not previously been taken into
consideration in work on digital technology for children’s outdoor
play. It has been shown that these forms of play appear to have
both health benefits [ 79 ] and promote pro-social behaviour [ 38, 52 ].
Such benefits are at risk, if the ways in which children already play
in nature-rich settings are not fully considered in the design of
digital play tools.

This article presents a study on how play evolves when digital
installations are present in nature-rich settings. We had the unique
opportunity to study children’s self-directed play [2] in nature-rich
locations with access also to digital installations. In contrast with
previous studies, this allowed us to shift focus from the installa­
tions as such, to instead study how the children’s play activities
emerged in relation to the rich palette of materials present. Our
study takes into consideration all of digital installations, nature
materials, landscape features, and non-digital installations, with the
aim to uncover similarities and differences between how children
engage with digital installations and with other materials present in
nature-rich settings. This also means that we do not make any a pri­
ori distinction between digital play and nature-based play. Rather,
we make note of which materials are recruited into play to uncover
how the different materials inspire play engagement.

To shift focus from studying the play installations in isolation,
we adopted a method from landscape architecture studies, to elicit
how children engage in _situated_ _play_ _episodes_ [ 51 ]. A situated play
episode is an identifiable unit in children’s play activity that can
undergo continuous change, with the children moving between
different sites, children entering and leaving the activity, and the
children modifying their narrative and overall play agreement [7]
as play evolves. This concept was developed to capture the openended type of play that is common in outdoor settings [ 51 ]. The
approach allows us to move away from placing focus on singular
materials or installations, to instead study how play emerges in
interaction with the place and the materials at hand.

The play episodes analysed in this study were collected during
four observation sessions in which groups of children were play­
ing freely in four different settings. Two of the settings included
digital installations, and the other two were a park with regular
playground installations, and a forest area with no artificial play
equipment. Through a combined analysis of qualitative data sources
(video recordings, observation notes and interviews) we elicited
30 situated play episodes over all four areas. This article is based
on a qualitative analysis of this material, to answer the following
research questions:

  - Are there differences between how children engage with
digital installations and nature materials in outdoor play,
and if so, what are the possible reasons for these?

  - Based on any observed differences, what challenges and
opportunities do we see for designing digital outdoor play
installations for nature-rich settings?
Our findings show that play with nature materials versus digital
installations emerged in _different_ ways. Engagement with digital

installations typically involved an active exploration phase, which
was rare to non-existent with other materials, and which strongly
influenced the subsequent play engagement. With nature materials
on the other hand, sensory exploration was playful in and of itself.
Second, we did not observe imaginative play emerging in the en­
gagement with digital installations, that rather inspired rule-based
play. Finally, the ways in which many nature materials are col­
lectable, consumable and malleable strongly influenced children’s
play engagement with them, and contributed to their attractiveness.
We argue that in order to ensure that the psychological and health
benefits of play in nature, this motivates rethinking the design of
digital installations for nature-rich settings and suggest guidelines
to this purpose.


**2** **Background**

**2.1** **Children’s** **Outdoor** **Play**


Studies of children’s outdoor play have begun to uncover how the
ambiguity and constantly changing characteristics of biological,
geological and seasonal processes present outdoors [ 69 ] are for­
mative for children ́s play. Nature features also trigger pro-social
behaviour [ 38, 52 ]. When there is an abundance of nature materials

[ 56 ] it forms a common ground making it more likely that children
of different genders, ages, competences and interests, can negotiate
and play together [ 82 ]. An example is how an intervention [ 34 ] in
which plants were added to an otherwise barren environment led to
an increase in imaginative play and socializing. Nature’s restorative
effects has also been shown to be supportive of a general capability
to handle stress and life challenges and higher achievements in
school [ 79 ]. Vegetation and other nature features tend to fascinate
children and instil sense of wonder [ 41, 43 ], and in their play and
social interactions, nature features make play more flexible, diverse
and open-ended [ 51 ]. Play in nature is characterised by flux and
transformation [ 50, 79 ]: children tend to engage in swift and playful
movements [ 42 ], experimenting with materials in ways that extend
their functions. For all of these reasons, a general decrease in out­
door play [ 16 ] and unequal access to green play settings [ 72 ] has
increasingly been regarded as a threat to children ́s overall health
and development [20].

These observations underlie recent approaches to both play­
ground design [ 26 ] and incorporation of digital materials in out­
door settings [ 65 ]. However, we still know little about how digital
installations interact with nature features in green play settings.


**2.2** **Digital** **Outdoor** **Play**


As traditional outdoor play is considered challenged by digital
play in children’s lives [ 35 ], many scholars have considered ways
in which digital technology could be designed to enrich outdoor
play and possibly make the outdoor environment more attractive
to children. Previous design experiments include fixed outdoor
installations [ 3, 8, 23, 60, 63, 73, 75 ] but also loose play artefacts

[ 35, 70 ] and collections of artefacts or apps that work as modular
building blocks [ 22, 24, 49, 71 ]. As with traditional playground
installations, the purpose has often been to foster physical activity
(e.g. [ 49, 55, 78 ]), but there are also efforts to support more versatile
and creative play [ 3, 8, 22, 23, 60, 70, 73 ]. Multiple authors (see e.g.

[ 11, 35, 70, 75 ]) propose that digital play artefacts should provide


Digital Play in Nature CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan



open-ended feedback as this can inspire exploration and creativ­
ity, rather than e.g. implement games with fixed scores. Several
also recommend providing adaptable or re-programmable functions

[ 2, 5 ]. Revisiting multiple experiences of designing for outdoor play,
Fails and Jones [ 25 ] have suggested design recommendations for
the design of digital tools for play in nature. Their recommenda­
tions include using narratives to stimulate the children’s interest
and supporting exploration in open, generative and creative ways.
However, they also consider outdoor play activities to be activities
that have adults present and urge designers to consider the need to
keep children safe, recommendations that can be challenged from
an environmental psychology perspective [68].

Child-computer interaction research has also uncovered how
digital play artefacts can be designed to foster long-lasting and
creative play engagements. Inspired by toy research [ 37 ], De Valk
et al. [ 75 ] developed design principles for open-ended feedback to
foster open-ended play which consists of three phases. The first
phase is when the play artefact attracts the children’s attention and
invites them to play with it. When the children begin interaction
with the artefact, a phase of _exploration_ follows, eventually moving
into a phase of _immersive_ _play_, in which the children play in an
intense and focussed way with the artefact and each other. De Valk
et al considers it desirable that immersive play should also, now
and then, shift back to exploration, when the children detect new
usages for the artefact, as this can encourage long-lasting creative
play behaviours. Back et al. [ 7 ] suggest that such shifts do not
just depend on discovering new functionalities, but also emerge
through social negotiations and transgressive behaviour among the
children. In relation to outdoor digital play installations, Back et al.

[ 8 ] furthermore suggest that it might be more appropriate to study
the capacity for designs to foster _recurring_ play, as children seldom
get the opportunity to play for very long periods of time outdoors,
but on the other hand are likely to visit the same outdoor settings
recurrently.


**2.3** **Bridging** **Concepts** **when** **Approaching** **Play**
**from** **Interaction** **Design** **and** **Landscape**
**Studies**


The reported project takes an interdisciplinary approach to the
study of outdoor play, bridging interaction design, environmental
psychology and landscape architecture research. While the dis­
ciplines have a common foundation in behavioural science and
share many theories and concepts, these are slightly differently
applied. In this section we bring forth similarities and differences
in conceptualisations of _affordances_ and _open_ _play_ in the different
fields, in an effort to support joint language [ 21 ]. In this article,
these concepts are used with a clear reference to the respective
fields when necessary. Finally, we discuss the play typology chosen
for analysis in this study.

**The** **concept** **of** **affordances** has a prominent position in dis­
cussions of technology design as well as in studies of children ́s
outdoor environment. The concept originates in Gibson’s proposal
that our way of perceiving the world is grounded in a preparedness
for moving around and making use of our surroundings [ 30, 33 ].
Through this preparedness, we acknowledge distinct functional
properties in the environment depending on our constitution and



capacity, e.g. observing various features as being climbable, slideable, swingable, and so forth. Within playground research, multiple
authors have discussed how different affordances in the physical en­
vironment [ 17, 32, 47, 62 ] affect children’s play. Studies in _landscape_
_research_ and _environmental_ _psychology_ document children ́s playful
interaction and exploration of affordances outdoors, focussing on
nature materials and various features in the environment including
playground gear [ 26, 27, 47, 50 ]. It should be noted that seasonal
variation and weather conditions also provide affordances for play

[67].

In _interaction_ _design_, focus has more commonly been placed
on how affordances can be _designed_ [ 46 ], through a deliberate
process that determines which functionalities an artefact should
offer and how these should be communicated to users. Norman

[ 57 ] first made use of the concept of affordances to describe such
design choices. The relational perspective on affordances as the
individual’s orientation to their environment tends to be less in
focus in this work. However, designed artefacts mostly offer both
affordances that have been deliberately designed, and such that
emerge anyways e.g. from unintended code interactions (bugs),
from physical properties of an artefact, and from the social and
physical environment in which the artefact is situated.

Human beings are, by both nature and previous exposure, well
attuned to nature affordances and experience little challenge in
relating to them. Designed artefacts offer less of such affordances,
while instead offering modes of use that are uncommon or unique.
Finding ways of communicating digital affordances as clearly and
easily as possible has been a central consideration in design [ 29 ],
even though the goal of offering unambiguous and clear affordances
has become increasingly challenged as it also can restrict the pos­
sible usage options [ 61 ]. Proposals to capitalize on ambiguity in
design [ 28 ] and the previously mentioned strategy to design for
open-ended play [ 75 ] challenge the predominant approach of pro­
viding affordances with clearly delimited usages.

**Open-ended** **play** is another important consideration across the
research fields, again a concept used slightly differently. In interac­
tion design, the term is primarily used in contrast to game design

[ 9, 60 ], which steers interaction towards limited goals (predomi­
nantly winning) and thus limits the opportunities for participants
to re-invent their ongoing play activity. Open-ended play then
emerges from engaging with open-ended interaction designs that
do not have a set purpose or win condition, making them open for
appropriation e.g. so that game goals can be socially negotiated [ 7 ].
In literature on children ́s outdoor play environments, open-ended
play refers to how play is more flexible and open for change in out­
doors settings [ 50 ] than in other settings, and argues that activities
of sensory exploration and playful use of affordances lie at the core
of such play. As discussed in the background these are also forms
of engagement that are associated with restorative play [42].


**2.4** **An** **Outdoor** **Play** **Typology**


A plethora of typologies for children ́s play exist [ 81 ], most devel­
oped for the purpose of studying children’s play development. In
our work, we made use of the Tool for Observing Play Outdoors
(TOPO) [ 48 ], with slight adaptations. This typology is grounded in
established categorisations of children’s play [ 64 ] but tailored for

children ́s play behaviour outdoors with access to nature elements.
TOPO divides children’s play into nine categories: Movement, Ex­
plorative, Imaginative, Play with rules, Expressive, Restorative,
Digital, Bioplay and Restorative. Each category of play is further
divided into sub-categories.

The categories used in this study were adapted from TOPO with
two modifications. Digital play was omitted as a category of its
own, as the digital installations (and actually, some other digital
materials) were instead considered play materials. For the same
reason, Bioplay was named nature play and categorised not by
what kind of biological material was used, but by what ways in
which children the children engaged with the materials. The re­
sulting eight categories are shown in Table 1. In addition to these
classifications, we noted down which materials the children made
use of in the play episode (this is further discussed in the method
section).
In the analysis conducted for this paper, that builds on a combina­
tion of observer notes, video analysis and interview transcripts, a
selection of these categories emerged as the most salient forms of
engagement, and are therefore described here in more detail.

**Explorative** **play** is an important factor in children’s cogni­
tive and social development [ 77 ] and a common element in play.
TOPO distinguishes between Sensory exploration, in which the
exploration is mainly directed towards sensory experiences, Active
exploration which is when “a child attentively explores an object
or the environment in an active and attentive manner, and Con­
struction (here discussed as Constructive play) which is when the
children reshape materials constructing something else out of them.
_Sensory_ _Exploration_ is a fundamental aspect of children’s play, inte­
grated in their very first playful interactions with the world around
them [ 59, 64 ] and characteristic for a lot of play outdoors where
children attentively explore the surroundings. While Movement
play is classified separately in TOPO, both _Gross_ _Motor_ play and
_Vestibular_ _Play_ also include aspects of sensory exploration through
the proprioceptive senses [ 45 ]. The concept of _Active_ _Exploration_
originates in studies of science centre installations, where it is typi­
cally directed towards figuring out the function of a science centre
exhibit, but active exploration is also possible in nature settings
and could e.g. involve manipulating a flow of water to change its
course. _Constructive_ _Play_ is often associated with materials that
are loose and malleable such as sand, toys, sticks, boards, and tools.
Particular for constructive play is children’s ideas dominating the
materials, which is recruited in order to _construct_ something out of
them. This type of play tends to leave traces of reshaped material.



Sandcastles and elaborate huts are classical examples, but com­
monly the result of children ́s creative activity can be very modest
constructions [44].

**Play** **with** **rules** is when the children collectively adopt a set
of game-like rules to structure their activity. This can sometimes
include a ‘win’ condition. The resulting activity becomes similar
to a game, that can be collaborative or competitive, or both. Rulebased play is considered _Conventional_ _rule-based_ when the game
is known by all of the children and the ruleset is more or less
strictly adhered to. It is considered _Organic_ _rule-based_ when the
children do not adopt a pre-existing game but invent their own,
often underspecified, set of rules. Typically, organic play activities
are constantly re-negotiated, subject to frequent changes in rules,
goals, and roles [7].

**Imaginative** **play** emerges when children engage their fantasy
in different ways [ 48 ]. Typically, this involves re-signifying some­
thing, including enacting roles, designating a place to be their home,
or re-signifying materials to represent something else in the play
activity (e.g. a stick becomes a horse). The three subcategories in
TOPO ( _Symbolic_, _Socio-dramatic_ and _Fantastic_ ) are based on how
literature on children’s play development see these as progressively
more advanced forms of imaginative play. In our study, it turned
out to be difficult to draw clear lines between them, why only the
top category was used in the analysis.

In addition to the TOPO categories, our analysis also makes
note of instances of **work** **play** [ 8 ]. This concept has been used to
describe a form of play that seems to be common in social play with
digital outdoor installations. In this form of play, the children are
intensely engaged with creating maximum result from the digital
feedback, often under the guidance of a child acting as leader. While
work play seems particularly common with digital installations,
it emerges also in play in nature as children confronted with the
challenges of nature children will sometimes take these on together,
such as e.g. collecting all the water from drainage or helping each
other reach a tough height [ 50 ]. Within the TOPO categorization,
‘work play’ falls under play with rules and is typically organic, but
could potentially be conventional depending on how closely the
installations guide its rules. Due to its prevalence in play with
digital installations we made special note of instances of work play.


**3** **METHOD**


Children’s self-directed play was observed in four different settings
with access to a range of play materials. Below, the settings are


Digital Play in Nature CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan



described to illustrate the variety of materials and environmental
features that influenced the children’s play, and then the digital
installations included in the study are described. We finally detail
how data was collected and analysed.


**3.1** **Settings**

The selected settings were chosen to cover nature-rich environ­
ments with and without digital installations, as well as with and
without dedicated play equipment such as swings, climbing frames,
and benches. The reason for including also traditional playground
installations was to allow us to understand to what extent the play
behaviours emerging with digital installations would also emerge
with other artificial installations. All four settings were around
3500 square meters and offered access to nature features and loose
materials. Finally, all four settings were authentic outdoor en­
vironments, and the installations were in place permanently or
semi-permanently. The settings were roped off for the duration of
the study.


  - “ **Mixed** ” was located in a park that includes two digital in­

stallations: the “hut” located within and the “eggs” located
on the border of a forest area. The setting also included a
traditional playground with swings and various climbing
gear, and parts of the surrounding park. The latter is domi­
nated by lawn but adjacent to the playground there are some
boulders surrounded by grass of meadow character.

  - “ **Digital** **forest** ” was located in a forest and included three
digital installations (the “sound poles”, the “light poles” and
the “tubes” and two non-digital installations. The forest is
dominated by conifer trees, with much visible bedrock and
stones and some ferns and shrubs in between, and large trails
of trampled land across the area. The non-digital installa­
tions were 1) a large hand sculpted out of wood, that was
climbable, and 2) a large metal ring hung high between three
trees, about three meters above ground, out of reach for the
children. Else, the area was similar to the Forest setting de­
scribed below and had both trees and ravines. The ground
was however more trampled and had less moss and berries.

  - **“Traditional”** was located in a park with traditional play­

ground installations and no digital installations. This setting
included a climbing frame with a slide, four swings, a sand­
box with a small wooden house, all adjacent to a large open
grass area also including perennial and shrub plantings, seat­
ing, a number of trees and a paved walkway across the area.

  - **“Forest”** was a forest area without digital installations con­

taining small groves, one particularly high spruce, a small
ravine, a high cliff overlooking the area, some slopes and
trampled nature trails across the ground with an under­
growth of blueberry and lingonberry.

A previous publication [ 66 ] was based on quantifiable data (in­
cluding step counts, behaviour tracking and questionnaires) from
three of the sessions (“Forest”, “Digital Forest”, and “Traditional”)
to elicit macro-scale differences in play engagement between them.
The most notable difference between these three sessions was that
the children in the forest setting engaged in play that was more
versatile, with higher incidence of imaginative play and physical
activity than in the two other settings. The article also reported



that out of these three sessions, the children reported lowest scores
for satisfaction in the Digital Forest setting. The analysis reported
in this paper is based on the data from these three sessions plus the
Mixed setting obtained using the same methods as described below,
but uses qualitative data (video recordings, observation notes, and
interviews with the children) from all four sessions to go more in
depth on the children’s play engagement, thus contributing with a
qualitative understanding of how the macro-scale differences may
have emerged.


**3.2** **Play** **session** **setup**

One observation session was carried out in each of the four settings.
The observation sessions in the “Traditional”, “Digital Forest” and
“Forest” settings were conducted during October 2020. Children
from the same nearby school attended all three sessions. A fourth
session (in the “Mixed” setting) took place in March 2021 in another
city, with children participating from a nearby school in that city [3] .

In each observation session, groups of 14–17 children aged 7–8
took part. Written consent was obtained from parents. To ensure
the children’s own consent, children were verbally informed about
the purpose and setup of the study before each session, and in­
formed that they could choose to not participate or drop out at any

time.

The sessions were run in the same way in all four settings. Each
area was roped off in order to restrict observations to the children
who had consented to participate in the study and their teachers.
Each child was equipped with a numbered vest (for identification
on video) and a step counter. The children were informed that they
could play whatever they wanted within the roped-off area. After
45 minutes all activity was aborted by a teacher blowing a whistle.
Researchers would then gather groups of children to perform ‘walk
and talk’ interviews, during which the children told the researcher
about what they had been playing and what materials they had
been using. Finally, each child filled out a written questionnaire
containing scaled questions on their activity and experience of
the session, with the support of a researcher and/or teacher when
required. (The step counter and questionnaire data are not discussed
in this article.)

The study was submitted for ethical approval to the Swedish
Ethical Review Authority, that concluded that no ethical approval
was needed.


**3.3** **Data** **Collection**


This paper builds on data from play tracking, video recordings, and
interviews with the children.

**Play** **tracking.** The play tracking consisted of structured obser­
vations, and were carried out by the same researchers in all four
settings. Each play setting was divided into three zones, with one
observer in each zone making notes of the activities. The researcher
stayed in one zone for 15 minutes, and then rotated, visiting all
zones at least once during the full observation session. Each situated
play episode was documented in a field note protocol (see Figure 1).


3 The observant reader might notice that all four sessions were run during the pandemic.
The study was possible since schools and after-school activities were not closed in
Sweden during the pandemic. However, in one of the sessions (the “Forest” session),
parts of the research team could not participate due to recommendations concerning
travel to and from the city where they lived.

The protocol included a map of the area, and had dedicated slots
for documenting the play types according to the TOPO-typology

[ 48 ], the time of observation, the materials children used, and an
assessment of children ́s expressions of mood (the latter not used
in this article). A custom-made selection of the materials used by
children was pre-scripted and included both nature materials such
as sticks and water, fixed nature features or artificial installations,
and digital audio or visual feedback. The list had space for noting
down materials not on the list. Finally, the protocol had space for
making open field notes, for example documenting the children’s
dialogue.

Validity and reliability of the tracking were improved by ob­
servers having trained on classifying children’s play. A post-session
analysis of data showed that the same situated play episodes had
been identified with observer agreement on the major TOPO clas­
sifications for these, although there were some discrepancies in the
sub-category classifications.



**Video** **documentation.** Nine GoPro cameras were used to

document each play session including the post-play walk and talk
interviews. Before the play sessions, the cameras were placed in
strategic locations. Each camera was either dedicated to providing
a close-up capture of installations or environmental features that
were likely to inspire play activity, or presenting an overview of
a larger area. Apart from capturing movement and activity, the
close-up cameras were also able to capture some of the dialogue
between the children. The location and angle of video capture
for each camera were plotted on a map. In each session, four to
five cameras were focussed on specific installations or landscape
features, and the rest were used for providing overviews covering
the roped-off area as thoroughly as possible. The photos used in
the article have been extracted from the video recordings. Children
visible on video have been anonymized through being redrawn as
black body shapes.

**Post-Play** interviews with the children. After each play session,
the researchers gathered the children in groups of one to four,
based on the location they were in and the group they had been
playing with at the end of the session. This way, the children were
interviewed in self-selected groups that had been playing together
at that time. The interviews were carried out in a walk-and-talk
manner, with the children showing us where and how they had
been playing. The interviews were video recorded.


**3.4** **Analysis:** **Identifying** **and** **Describing**
**Situated** **Play** **Episodes**

This article uses “situated play episodes” [ 50 ] as its object of analysis.
Mårtensson (IBID) describes these as a way of organising children’s
play activities into identifiable units characterized by one or several
of the following elements: 1) a core group of children involved, 2)
a place or central object which children attend to, or 3) a narrative
lingering in the episode, or set of rules negotiated. Situated play
episodes evolve through interactions with peers and place, making
them both visually and audibly observable (IBID).

The identification and documentation of situated play episodes
was done in three steps. Firstly, the observation protocols from play
tracking by multiple observers were combined, when they docu­
mented different phases of the same play episode. A few, short-lived

episodes were only documented by a single observer, but most were
documented by several, as the observers rotated between the dif­
ferent zones. Next, field notes were matched against the video
recordings to create a more precise description of their duration
and participants. This required reviewing all video recordings to
identify video recordings that captured the observed episodes, but
also to see if some episodes could be identified that had not been
observed by the observers. During this review, we also made com­
plementary notes of environmental features and materials used in
each identified situated play episode. For easy reference, each situ­
ated play episode was named, denoting the activity and/or feature
in focus, and sometimes its social set-up. Finally, play episodes
were transcribed based on a combination of field notes and video
recordings, including their timing, children’s utterances, observable
interactions and use of material. The post-play interviews were
transcribed to supplement the observations with children’s account
of their play experience. Based on the combined data for each
episode, the TOPO classifications [ 48 ] done during observations
were also revisited and refined. The process involved at least two

researchers reviewing the video material for each identified play
episode, and contributing to its transcription.
An overview of all documented episodes is available in Appendix
1. Episodes are classified according to their main TOPO classifi­
cations with an additional note of instances of Work play. Each
episode is classified into one or two categories. When possible, we
also discriminate between sub-categories for each play type.

The table also includes the materials that the children engaged
with during the episode. This list has been compiled from observer
notes and video analysis. Digital installations are listed as materials
as soon as the children engaged with them in any way at all, even
if brief. In all except one play episode they also engaged with
their interactive functionalities. The one exception is the _Old_ _Witch_
episode, which is made special note of in the table. The table also
includes short descriptions of the play behaviour and the number
of children involved.


It should be noted that while the data collection and analysis
process allowed us to develop a rich and in-depth understanding of
the children’s play episodes, the analysis does not cover all episodes
that emerged. The video recordings captured fragments of episodes
that are too incomplete to be transcribed, and it is possible that
some play episodes were missed by both observers and cameras.



**3.5** **Digital** **installations**

The five digital installations included in this study were all designed
to be placed in nature-rich settings. All are also open-ended designs,
leaving space for playful exploration and social negotiation, and
some had been designed with the specific intention to interact well
with nature play. Furthermore, their placement in the surrounding
landscape had been done with attention to how they can entice
children to play in nature-rich settings. Hence, they are particularly
well suited for our study. Their designs are however quite differ­
ent, both in what play activities they support and the motivations
underlying their designs. In this section, we present the five instal­
lations included in the study and the rationale behind their designs
and placement. The digital installations were present in two of the
settings: the digital forest contained three installations (The tubes,
The Running Poles and the Sound Poles), and the “Mixed” location
two (The Eggs and the Hut).


_3.5.1_ _The_ _Tubes._ The Tubes are a semi-permanent installation in
a forest area (see Figure 2) combining two tubes equipped with
sensors, and both sound and LED panel feedback. In line with the
bricolage approach towards integrating technology with nature
play suggested in [ 80 ], the installation is designed to integrate
play with nature materials in green settings with engagement with


CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Annika Waern et al.



the Tubes [ 65 ]. The two tubes are equipped with sensors that are
triggered by moisture, sound, and movement which allows them
to react to qualities that different types of nature materials can
have. One sensor responds to movement for objects such as pine
cones, stones, sticks, leaves, or moss. A sound sensor reacts to
vibrations when heavier objects such as stones rattle through the
tubes. Finally, a moisture sensor responds to wet items such as
water or damp moss. Adopting an open-ended design approach,
the Tube installation does not implement a clear goal but lets the
children incorporate the feedback in their play narratives. The
sounds used for feedback reflect the properties of the materials:
wetness is signaled through the sound of running water, vibrations
with the sound of a rolling stone, and the movement sensor is
connected to a tingling sound. The visual feedback comes in the
form of three light pillars in blue, green, and red that represent
each of the sensors.

A wooden frame ‘play hut’ complements the installation with
an additional LED feedback panel that provides combined feedback
from the tubes. This setup offers opportunities for fostering so­
cial play, with children taking different roles in interacting with
different parts of the installation. Previous studies with similar
installations have reported that the setup can foster work play

[4, 8].

The tubes were carefully placed at the site in dialogue with the
local municipality authority, to be visible from a regular park nearby,
this in order to invite play in a forest area that previously had been
very little in use. The place was also carefully considered to provide
a ‘den’ feeling, by how the tubes were partly enclosed by two larger
rocks.


_3.5.2_ _The_ _Running_ _Poles._ These poles were placed close to the
border of a regular park (see Figure 2). This installation consists
of four poles in a circle containing a multi-coloured light source
and a speaker. Each pole has a button on its top surface. Pressing
a button on one pole triggers another, random, pole’s light and
sound. Each pole has a different animal sound. Both light and
sound then fade gradually, unless somebody presses the button at
the top of the pole which in turn triggers another pole. The design
of this installation built on positive experiences in previous studies
with similar installations [ 8 ], which indicate that they can foster a
variety of playful games. The main design consideration for this
installation was thus to be open-ended, so that it could be used for
a number of games and playful activities [ 65 ]. In dialogue with the
municipality, this installation was placed at the very border of the
nature-rich area, so that it could be accessible by wheelchair as the
ground material is hard gravel connecting to grass.


_3.5.3_ _The_ _Music_ _Poles._ This installation is based on the same type
of interactive poles as the Running Pole installation, but the na­
ture around this installation is wilder with high grass and ferns
and uneven terrain (see Figure 2). These are landscape properties
that commonly inspire nature play, and the purpose of using this
location was to connect the installation closely to the nature sur­
rounding it. The uneven ground and the more fragile greenery
made this spot unsuitable for the running poles, why this instal­
lation implemented a different function. Five poles are placed in
a circle, and programmed to change colour and produce different
sounds each time they are pressed. Each pole has a unique playlist,



containing beats, vocal sounds, ambience sounds, or musical instru­
ments, contributing to a complex sound landscape and supporting
collective music generation [ 65 ]. The placement of this installation
was also done in dialogue with the municipality, The location was
chosen so that the poles would be less visible from the regular park
area but instead clearly visible from the other two digital installa­
tions, so that its placement would encourage moving through the
forest area.


_3.5.4_ _The_ _Eggs._ The Eggs are permanently installed on the border
between a forest and a traditional playground area in the Mixed
setting (see Figure 3). The Eggs were designed in close collaboration
with the municipality, with a strong focus on core values stated by
the municipality including democracy, inclusivity, accessibility, and
pedagogical purposes [ 6 ]. Their placement is intended to function
as a link between the forest and the traditional playground, where
the playground works as a play invitation to both children and
adults, and the eggs may entice them to move also into the forest

area.

The eggs are two identical one-metre-high eggs inspired by wild
bird eggs, dug into the ground, and digitally connected to each other
so that actions at one of them can affect the other. Each egg has 16
touch-sensitive areas that can light up, and the eggs can produce
a variety of sounds. Just as the running poles, one of the eggs is
placed to be wheelchair accessible through a dirt road. The other,
placed about 5-10 meters into the forest does not have any dedicated
walkways, a placement that is intended to draw the children into
the forest just as the placement of the Tubes. Furthermore, the eggs
are placed so that the view between them is semi-obstructed by a
tree, to further integrate them into the surrounding landscape and
turn the tree into part of the playing, when interacting between
the eggs.

The eggs are reprogrammable through a graphical online pro­
gramming interface [ 5 ]. At the time of our observation session, the
eggs offered one idle behaviour and three different play behaviours.
When idle, the eggs pulsated in different colours. When they were
touched, one of the play behaviours would start, depending on the
current colour of the egg. The scenarios were 1) a running-hunting
scenario, where one dot would light up, and when touched it would
move to another position on the egg. 2) a scenario where dots
would light up randomly, and then slowly fade away. By touching
the active dots, they would light up fully again, and this way they
could be ‘kept alive’. 3) a colouring scenario, where dots would
change colour each time they were touched, making it possible to
paint the egg into any colour the participant wished. This scenario
was mirrored between the two eggs, making it possible to affect
the other egg across distance.


_3.5.5_ _The_ _Hut._ The Hut was designed during the same process as
the eggs, in close collaborations with the municipality, and with a
strong focus on the same core values. It is a permanent installation,
placed in the forest area in the Mixed setting and close to the eggs
described above (see Figure 3). It is accessible via a small dirt road
from the traditional playground. It is intended to afford also calmer
forms of play, listening, imagining, and relaxation and has a strong
focus on storytelling in line with what is suggested in [ 25 ]. Just as
the Eggs, the Hut is reprogrammable and several play behaviours
can be offered [ 5 ]. At the time of testing, three behaviours were

active: 1) a scenario containing short stories about the animals in
the forest, based on the actual fauna in the park. The animals in
the stories are also present in the area in the form of small statues.
2) a music scenario with upbeat music, making the Hut resemble a
disco, and 3) a completely silent scenario with steady lights, for calm
play or play activities where the other behaviours would not be
appropriate. A long-term study of the hut has shown that the story­
telling incorporated in the installation can spur story-informed play
in the vicinity of the hut [40].

The hut has one round window and is designed to resemble a
bird house. Inside are four interactive tree stump stools, one in
each corner, and four spotlights in the roof each aimed at one of
the stools. In the ceiling, there are additional multi-coloured mood
lights and loudspeakers. The stools are equipped with sensors that
can sense if somebody is sitting on them. The hut is made out
of unpainted wood, letting it take on more and more of a natural
colour over time, and it is placed so that the door faces the forest,
making nature the main view when sitting down inside.


**4** **Results**

**4.1** **A** **Play** **Type** **Analysis** **of** **the** **Observed**
**Episodes**


Appendix 1 presents a full overview of the situated play episodes
together with their play types and the materials that were observed
being in use. Table 2 maps the materials used in play episodes
against the dominant play types of the same episodes. To correspond to our first research question, the table distinguishes between
digital materials, nature materials including fixed nature elements
(e.g. boulders), and other artificial materials including both fixed
installations and portable artefacts (e.g. balls and buckets). Since
several play episodes had multiple play types and involved several



types of materials, the play episodes sometimes occur in multiple
places.

The dominant play types of the observed episodes were restricted
to sensory and gross motor play, active exploration, imaginative
play, organic rule-based play and a few cases of constructive play
(see Table 2). As can be seen already in the table, there is a distinct
difference in how different types of materials were used in the
different types of play. In particular, organic rule-based play being
almost solely associated with digital installations and imaginative
play with nature materials. Below, we will discuss each of the
play types in more detail. Furthermore, we can see how active
exploration almost exclusively emerged with digital materials.

Two play episodes are described more in detail as examples of
how organic rule-based play emerged with digital installations,
and imaginative play with nature materials. These are included
as Vignettes. Both are also examples of sustained and quite elabo­
rate play activities, involving groups of children and fluctuating in
different ways. Both are also well documented on camera and in
observer notes. Compiled transcriptions for these two episodes can
be found in Appendix 2, including observer notes, video transcripts,
and excerpts from the interviews.


**4.2** **Organic** **Rule-based** **Play** **is** **Common** **with**
**Digital** **Installations**

_4.2.1_ _Vignette:_ _The_ _Light_ _Chase_ _Episode._ The Light Chase episode
(4) emerged in the Digital Forest setting and lasted about 18 minutes
total, with some short breaks in between and with children now
and then joining and leaving the episode. It is recognizable as
an episode through the way in which a consistent set of rules is
developed, through some of the materials in use (in particular, the
running poles) and through a core set of children that are involved
throughout. A compiled transcript of the session can be found in
Appendix 2.

The episode starts with an active exploration phase during which
the children investigate the function of the poles. The way in
which the light can jump from pole to pole is discovered fairly
quickly. After about two minutes, an informal leader takes charge
and suggested a running game. (The informal leader seems to be
one of the most interested in this installation, later turning back
alone.) Negotiation emerges about who gets to run and who gets
to guard the poles.
The game that evolves is however different from the suggested:
two children stand guard at one pole each, and the third runs after
the light that now jumps between the remaining two poles.
After approximately seven minutes, three more children arrive.
The children at the poles, who have already developed an organic
rule-based game, instruct the newcomers in what to do. However,
the game breaks down as there are now more children than poles
so there are no more poles to run between. Due to their intense
button pressing, they instead discover a new function with the
posts: they start blinking intensely when all buttons are pressed



at once. The play activity now changes into trying to recreate this
effect. A noteworthy utterance at this point of time is the “harder,
harder, we have to fill it up”, indicating work play [ 8 ]. Many of the
children use sticks to hold the buttons in. One child starts dancing
in the middle of the ring of poles while hitting a multi-stemmed
birch with their stick, possibly as if it was their pole.
After this, the play episode ebbs out. One possible explanation
for this is that there are now too many children for the number
of poles. An alternative and complementary explanation could be
that standing still and keeping a button pressed is not a particularly
fun activity.
In the post-play interviews, the children described how the
episode changed nature when the children discovered a new func
tion:

The _Light_ _Chase_ episode in the Vignette is an example of how digital
installations inspired organic rule-based play. A common element
of such episodes is that they start with a phase of active exploration
(see Table 2), in which the children explore the functionality of the

installation. The episodes also tend to have an informal leader how
instructs the others and coordinates their play activity. The leader’s
suggestions are however not always accepted, and can be followed
by transgressions and negotiation of rules and roles [ 7 ]. The role as
‘leader’ can also be challenged, as when in the _Light_ _Chase_ episode,
the child with a stick who is dancing in the middle also attempts
to instruct the others. In literature, this type of hierarchical social
structure has been considered more common with the presence of
fixed playground installations than in nature settings [50].

Another instance of organic rule-based play emerged with the
Tubes in the Digital Forest, which inspired an intense play episode
(see Figure 5) lasting about eleven minutes and involving most of the
children present. The _Playhouse_ episode in the Mixed session was
of shorter duration, but otherwise similar to these two sessions. We
observed only one organic rule-based activity that did not involve
digital installations or digital materials: the _Ball_ episode in the
Traditional setting. This episode developed around a climbing gear
installation and is further discussed below.


**4.3** **Nature** **Nurturing** **Imaginative** **Play**

_4.3.1_ _Vignette:_ _The_ _Minecraft_ _Episode._ The Minecraft play episode
emerged in the Forest setting (see figure 6). It was identified as a
consistent episode through its uniform narrative and the group of
children involved. The episode lasted for almost the entire obser­
vation session, and involved four children with occasional visits
from other children. It also moved over a fairly large area with a
designated ‘home’. Minecraft is a computer game that is popular
among children this age, built on a sandbox paradigm. A compiled
transcript for this episode can be found in Appendix 2.

The suggestion to play Minecraft appeared as soon as the children
had entered the setting. One of the children repeatedly proposes to
go witch hunting (“Come NN we must kill the witch”), but the main
activity centers on developing their home and the finding materials
they need. Early on, the group select a large spruce with an open
space below as their home. When another group appropriate the
same tree, the Minecraft team move their home to a small height
covered with moss. They gather lingonberries to be their food. They
make a stove out of moss and scavenge sticks to be used as weapons.
Some important elements remain entirely imaginary, including a
safe, a helicopter, and an indestructible door.

Once the home is decently established, they start playing that
darkness is falling. (In the Minecraft computer game, this means
that dangerous creatures are afoot and that you have to stay in­
doors.) The following dialogue was captured on video:


_Hello,_ _it_ _is_ _starting_ _to_ _become_ _night!_

_Hurry,_ _it_ _is_ _beginning_ _to_ _become_ _night!_



_Here_ _is_ _our_ _house,_ _here!”_

_The_ _zombies_ _are_ _coming!_

_They_ _can_ _come_ _in!_

_We_ _have_ _to_ _make_ _a_ _fire!_


_A_ _witch!_


_Shut!_ _Shut!_


This play episode was discussed quite extensively during the postplay interviews. The children told us that they would sometimes
play Minecraft also in the school yard. When asked about what
materials they needed to play this game, they said that the game
can use a variety of materials:


_You_ _can_ _have_ _stones…_ _sticks,_ _a_ _mountain_ _to_ _be_ _on_ _and_
_lots_ _of_ _moss,_ _and_ _imagination…_ _and_ _blueberries_


_Sticks_


_And_ _stones_


_And_ _pine_ _sprigs_


_Instead_ _of_ _stones_


_And_ _instead_ _of_ _stones,_ _we_ _had_ _moss_ _because_ _it’s_ _much_
_easier_ _to_ _find_

Children playing Minecraft in the physical world has been documented previously [ 58 ]. The _Minecraft_ episode is a good illustration
of imaginative play, even if it also has some rule-like elements due
to its narrative as a computer game. Imaginative play was almost
solely observed in connection to nature features in the landscape.
It often made use of loose nature materials, emerging in combination with sensory exploration (and in our study, often in relation
to picking and eating berries). In the Minecraft episode, a host
of nature materials are used. As is typical of symbolic play, some
materials are also resignified, that is, they are used to represent
something that becomes meaningful in the fantastic context. An
example is how the stove is made of moss and how sticks are used
to represent weapons. In this particular episode, some play elements also remain entirely imaginary, while still placed physically
in selected locations. For example, one of the children showed us

their imagined safe by gesturing to a particular place during the
post-play interview.

Imaginative play in nature very often roamed large areas, some­
times settling temporarily or permanently by appropriating a place
through constructive play. The children playing Minecraft had
a home base and moved it once, but also roamed a fairly large
area. To mark the location of their house, they created a fire stove
(constructive play).

In our study, extended sessions of imaginative play were typically
accompanied by intense dialogue. Some play initiatives were not
picked up by the group, such as one child repeatedly wanting to
go “witch hunting”. When a play initiative was picked up it was
typically reiterated verbally by several participants (‘It’s getting
dark! The zombies are coming!”). It has been noted in literature that
verbal negotiation is needed less in green settings, as affordances
of nature also help to coordinate the activity [50].
Several other imaginative play episodes were observed in the Forest
setting, such as the _Spruce_ _Tree_ episode in which a group of children
were playing house under a tree. Other examples of imaginative
play episodes include _The_ _Old_ _Lady_ (Mixed setting) play episode,
which relied heavily on a pretence performance. One girl pretended
to be an old grumpy lady who chased away everyone else when
they came too close (see Figure 7). The children involved in this ac­
tivity used sticks to represent both weapons and canes, and roamed
the whole play area rounding the digital Egg installations several
times. The _Evolution_ play episode in the Mixed setting was also
heavy reliant on the children pretending. In this episode, a group of
children roamed the area picking up “powerups” to help imaginary



creatures evolve. Just as in the safe in the Minecraft episode, their
“creatures” were entirely imaginary, but the children chose locations
for their powerups based on landscape features in the environment,
in particular revisiting a meadow area several times. The nature
in the meadow area, including loose leaves, visiting birds, water
puddles and boulders, might have contributed to the overall vital­
ity and longevity of this episode. In all of these episodes, it was
predominantly nature materials that were resignified to represent
something else.


**4.4** **Sensory** **Exploration** **is** **Common** **when**
**Interacting** **with** **Nature**


Most sensory exploration and gross motor play episodes made use
of nature materials. The sensory exploration of such materials was
often at the core of the more loosely organized play episodes, in
which the children roamed across the play setting trying out its
various affordances. Especially in the Forest, we observed how
children would touch, bend and stroke twigs or small trees that
they passed along the way. Sensory play engagement ranged from
the casual ‘touch in passing’, to intense engagement such as when
the children went searching for, picked and ate berries in several of
the episodes (for example _Minecraft_ and _Pick_ _Berries_ _Duo_ ).

As discussed in the background vestibular and gross motor play
also involve sensory exploration, in these cases directed towards
the own proprioceptive senses. Both in the Forest and the Digital
Forest settings we observed episodes of gross motor play of the
‘the floor is lava’ kind, ( _Zombies_ _Duo_ and _Don’t_ _Touch_ _Ground_ ), in
which the children were balancing and climbing while roaming

the entire area. This roaming behaviour was particular for play in
nature-rich area: in the Traditional and Mixed settings, similar gross
motor play was more stationary with focus on fixed playground
installations. In the Digital Forest area, a hand sculpture was a
popular location for climbing, offering both gross motor activity
and sensory exploration of the carved surface. We also observed
one instance of ‘Rough and Tumble’ play (the _Tumble_ episode in
the Forest setting).

Sensory exploration was often ongoing in parallel with imag­
inative play, and/or with the children being engaged in intense
dialogue. Examples include the two children swinging and talking
in the Traditional setting (Swing-Duo) and the children moving
around in a ravine in the Forest area (The Ravine). In relation to the
digital installations, sensory exploration was briefly documented
with the Eggs (e.g. Figure 8) and the Sound Poles. In particular, the
children would climb on the eggs, run around them, and randomly
tap their interactive spots.


_4.4.1_ _Constructive_ _play_ _Recruiting_ _Malleable_ _Materials._ A particu­
larly elaborate form of sensory play emerges when materials are
actively collected and re-shaped. Several episodes became dedi­
cated to the collection of nature materials such as leaves, pinecones
and chestnuts. In the traditional setting, an abundance of loose
leaves and chestnuts became the focus for children ́s play, eventu­
ally merging into one and the same episode (the _Shop_ episode) in
which a group of children created a chestnut shop and museum,
and invited the others to visit. This episode lasted for almost the
entire observation session and grew to include almost all of the
children present. The participating children took clear pleasure
in the aesthetic qualities of the leaves and the chestnuts, and in
particular the museum was artistically executed with chestnuts
arranged on the wall by a flowerbed with care and attention to
detail.



Constructive play was mostly observed in conjunction with
imaginative play (such as when the children collected moss and
built a stove out of it during the _Minecraft_ episode), but in one case
with organic rule-based play. This happened in the _Ball_ episode, see
Figure 9, in which a group of children developed a ball-throwing
game. This game was about throwing a ball from a climbing tower
to the ground. One of the children created a large target in the
sand below the climbing tower, effectively re-purposes the entire
climbing tower from climbing into supporting their ball-throwing
game. In our study, we did not see constructive play emerge in
conjunction with digital materials.

Constructive play requires access to an abundance of loose ma­
terials, which we will discuss further in the next section.


**5** **Digital** **installations** **and** **nature** **materials**
**inspire** **different** **forms** **of** **play** **engagement**

In the results section, we uncovered some salient differences be­
tween the play episodes emerging around digital installations, and
those emerging in relation to nature and natural materials. In this
section, we will dig deeper into orthe possible reasons for these
differences.

We must first note that most of the digital installations showed
capacity to inspire open-ended play in the sense it has been de­
scribed in play technology literature [ 9, 10, 75, 76 ]. They were
installations attractive to the children inviting them to explore their
different functions and also evolving into a phase of immersion, as
described by De Valk et al [ 75 ], as intended by design. What stood
out in this study, comparing play episodes across a more diverse set
of settings, was how _different_ this form of engagement was from
the children’s engagement with nature materials, and the implica­
tions of this for the overall play flow. We have shown in the results
section how children ́s interaction with digital material tend to

develop into informal rule-based play, while their interaction with
nature material evolves into more elaborate play sessions including
imaginative play, sensory exploration, and constructive play. In
this section, we discuss what may underlie these differences.


**5.1** **Active** **Exploration** **is** **not** **Typical** **of** **Nature**
**Play**

There was a systematic difference between how the children ini­
tiated their play with digital installations, and how they began
to play with nature materials. With the interactive materials, the
children initially engaged in active exploration [ 48 ] (see Table 2)
scrutinizing their function. An example of this is how the children
first investigate the poles in the _Light_ _Chase_ episode, and similar
behaviour was observed in all instances of organic rule-based play
with digital installations. While active exploration could presum­
ably emerge also in nature play, we did not observe it in any play
episodes centred on nature materials. The likely explanation for
the difference is that the designed affordances of the digital instal­
lations were at the same time more limited and more difficult to
understand for the children, than those offered by nature materials.
Engaging with the digital material thus required active exploration
to figure out their functionality, and it was only after deciphering
(at least some of) the functionality that more playful interactions
begun to emerge. There was only one other episode documented in
the material in which a non-interactive material was approached in
a similar way: the _Ring_ episode in the digital forest setting, when
the children mistakenly believed that a non-functional installation
might be interactive and kept exploring its functionality.



The difference between active exploration and sensory explo­
ration helped us understand how children ́s response to nature
material differ from their response to digital materials. While ac­
tive exploration of a material can be a vital dimension of education
and learning [ 37 ], our observations indicate that it was not very
playful for the children. If the exploration did not bring about an
understanding of the functionality fairly quickly, the interactive in­
stallations were abandoned. (An example is the _Playhouse_ episode.)
This speaks against some earlier play literature which suggests
that active exploration can provide playful learning opportunities

[ 37, 76 ]. Play characterized by sensory exploration, drawing on
the aesthetic dimension of nature, sometimes lasted for extended
periods paving the way for imaginative play.

When children engaged in exploring the functions of interactive
installations, this strongly influenced how they subsequently played
with them. The uncovered affordances inspired social rules that
the children would suggest, negotiate and agree on. Furthermore,
despite the fact that all digital installations were designed to be
open-ended, several organic rule-based episodes included a goal,
implicitly indicated by the installations. The tubes installation is
a clear example of this, in how the children quickly adopted the
goal of ‘filling up’ the feedback bars, resulting an intense work play
episode. The designed affordances of digital installations were also
sometimes suggestive of roles for the participants to take on. The
children could for example divide the interactive functions between
themselves, such as at when the children in the _Light_ _Chase_ episode
adopted one light pole each.

Previous research has pointed out how easily interactive tools
give rise to competitions, especially when accumulated feedback is
used [ 35 ]. While we did not observe player to player competitions,


CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Annika Waern et al.



we did observe work play [ 8 ], which can be seen as the whole
group competing against a challenge offered by the technology or
the setting.

The designed affordances, implicit goals and suggested role di­
vision together explain why play episodes by digital installations
tend to become settings for organic rule-based play, and have a hard
time to gain the more fluent and versatile dimensions of children ́s
play which evolved in settings with nature and nature materials.


**5.2** **Nature** **Excels** **in** **Supporting** **Sensory**
**Exploration**


While nature material inspired sensory engagement – so called
sensory exploration – this was only rarely observed with artificial
materials or digital installations. The latter is surprising, as all of
the digital installations provided light and sound feedback, that in
the cases of the Eggs and the Sound poles were quite elaborate.

Nature settings, with their abundance of loose materials, excel in
offering sensory exploration. Nature offers a level of complexity and
high-resolution aesthetics speaking to many senses, so that deeper
inspection almost always uncovers new findings. The aesthetic
qualities of nature materials can inspire long-lasting and aesthetic
engagement, as in the _Shop_ episode where the activity revolves
around the different leaves and chestnuts being evaluated, sorted
and displayed.

In our study, among the digital installations the Egg installation
in the Mixed setting stood out, in terms of being aesthetically pleas­
ing through their organic shapes and texture, with coordinated
sounds and coloured lights. The Eggs were recruited into play in
several play episodes. While they sometimes were actively explored,
they were also incorporated into episodes in open-ended and fluent
ways, such as in _The_ _Old_ _Lady_ discussed above. This resembled how
children often would roam the environment gathering a variety of
sensory experiences in nature play.

A particularly strong play invitation was observed when children
got access to an abundance of loose materials as in the _Shop_ episode,
which took place a sunny day during those weeks in the autumn
when there is an abundance of chestnuts and leaves. Loose materials

are recognized as vital for children ́s self-directed play in general

[ 36, 55 ] and the accessibility to such in nature is an important
dimension of play in nature. Some materials such as sand and
sticks lend themselves to constructive play, water can be gathered
and poured out (as in the Tubes episode), ice and stones can be
cracked, leaves and pinecones burned, berries ingested, etcetera.

While it is difficult to see how digital installations can become
abundant in themselves, the Tube installation was designed to
capitalise on the presence of abundant loose materials, encouraging
children to collect sticks, pebbles and water etcetera and place them
in the tube to investigate its different effects. However, as work
play emerged, the children’s focus shifted from the aesthetics of
the materials themselves towards the collective goal of ‘filling up’
the feedback bars. The aesthetic qualities of loose materials that in
other play episodes inspired sensory exploration and imaginative
play, here became overshadowed by their role of being “fudder for
the machine” – and eventually the water ran out. While it has been
suggested that digital technology could support creating a stronger



affinity to nature, this type of effect could work to the contrary

[18].

An abundance of digital resources is entirely possible, as illus­
trated by the original Minecraft game [ 12 ]. Studies of online play
also indicate that it can offer aesthetic experiences similar to nature
experiences [ 74 ]. Hence, the digital material offers opportunities
for abundance, that potentially can be achieved using movable playtools such as the glowsteps [ 22 ], by using mobile technology to in­
spect nature [ 39 ], or by making fixed installations re-programmable
by their end users [5].


**5.3** **Digital** **Materials** **Tend** **to** **be** **Unfantastic**

Looking at the sustained play episodes, we see a clear difference be­
tween the ones inspired by digital materials and those supported by
nature materials. While the active exploration of digital materials
primarily inspired organic rule-based play, nature materials were
associated with sensory exploration paving the way for imaginative
play. An explanation for this difference could be that having access
to an abundance of nature materials was important in resignifica­
tion, as materials could be collected and shaped to resemble what
they represented. Previous research also points towards how chil­
dren take impression and fetch cues to their play activity from the
surroundings in fuelling their fantasy [ 44 ]. In this respect, nature
provides a rich and varied resource.

Furthermore, when recruited into imaginative play, nature mate­
rials were mostly resignified. We did not observe any play episode
where the digital installations were used to represent something
else. The most likely reason for this is how the initial active ex­
ploration of the digital installations tended to inspire rule-based
play rather than imaginative play. While related work has reported
observations of meaningful sounds triggering children’s fantasy

[ 36 ], there is a risk that symbolic feedback can become too precise
(e.g., an installation producing the sound of a cow would restrict it
to represent a cow). This would again hamper resignification and
limit the possible roles of the installation in play.


**6** **Design** **Challenges** **and** **Opportunities**


Based on the analysis of children’s play engagement, we now turn
to our second research question to pose some design challenges
and opportunities for future design of digital technology for play

in nature.


**6.1** **Design** **Challenges** **for** **Digital** **Outdoor** **Play**
**Installations**


The observation that digital installations fosters play in a different
way than nature materials is not problematic per se. Digital installa­
tions can still enrich a space to offer a wider palette of play activities
than impoverished everyday settings could offer otherwise [ 3, 8 ].
Digital installations can also foster exertion, e.g. through inspiring
work play, or have educational purposes. Previous studies show
how digital materials can function as invitations [ 8, 66 ] to investi­
gate and engage with spaces that otherwise might be perceived as
uninteresting or scary. Hence, digital installations can function as
invitations to explore nature, in particular for children having little

experience of playing in intimate contact with nature. This was con­
sidered in the placement of the installations included in this study,
and in this sense the installations were also largely successful.

However, we believe that previous digital design work for play in
nature has over-emphasised the value of both competitive play and
learning outcomes, over the importance of children’s self-directed
play. As brought up in the background, the health and pro-social
benefits of play in nature have been observed with children en­
gaging on their own terms and have been argued to outweigh the
benefits of more organized activities in nature [ 79 ]. There is no
guarantee that these benefits persist when play activities become
disciplined into learning activities or games.

There is also a risk that the digital materials will compete with
nature for the children’s attention. Nature risks becoming instru­
mentalised as in the _Tubes_ episode, and at a larger scale, digital
installations may overshadow the presence of nature. This may
have happened in the Digital Forest setting, as children did not
engage as much with the nature resources available in this session
as they did in the Forest session, despite having ample access to
nature materials in both.


**6.2** **Design** **Opportunities** **for** **Outdoor** **Digital**
**Installations**


In order to ensure that play in nature maintains its documented de­
velopmental and health benefits, designers need to place increased
focus on the kind of roaming, fluent and fluctuating playful activity
which is its signum. This requires increased attention on how in­
teractive installations can interact with their surroundings, present
a richness in the aesthetics in form and feedback, and take into ac­
count the surrounding landscape. In this, the design of interactive
installations can draw on available knowledge on how nature is
supportive to human functioning at large and children ́s play in
particular. The following guidelines provide a path towards such a
re-orientation of design approaches.


  - Refocus design efforts from encouraging active exploration
towards eliciting sensory exploration. A key element in this
would be emphasizing aesthetic design. Interactive technol­
ogy is capable of producing rich, varied and aesthetically
pleasing interactivity, as illustrated by the Egg installation.
This can add to children ́s sensory exploration, inspire imag­
inative play and possibly also align with their engagement
with the nature around the installations.

  - Consider in what ways digital materials can become an abun­

dant, rather than a scarce, resource. This can be done e.g.
through implementing ways to collect digital traces in the
environment (e.g. images and sounds), combining installa­
tions with mobile technology, or offering ways to reprogram
the interactivity of installations.

  - Take care to not overshadow nature, but instead integrate
seamlessly with the low-key and low-spoken aesthetic qual­
ities that nature features afford. Be sensitive to the sensory
qualities of nature features and materials, so that nature is
not used primarily as a resource for playing with the technol­
ogy. Consider if technology can be a resource for exploring

nature.




  - Instead of focussing on creating interesting functionalities in
singular installations, work with supporting children ́s play­
ful activity and mobility at large. Pay attention to placement.
Develop an understanding for their possible moves and inter­
actions with and around installations while roaming nature,
in order to support a more fluent and ever-changing play
flow where the digital materials are supportive to children ́s
overall exploration of nature and nature materials.


_6.2.1_ _Limitations_ _of_ _study._ An important limitation of the pre­
sented study is that the children were new to the digital installa­
tions. While the children were well acquainted with playing in both
nature and playground settings and with using nature materials
and playground equipment, the digital installations were alien to
them. If the children had been acquainted also with the digital
installations, it is likely that they would have required less time
to investigate their functions, and potentially they could already
have developed play activities for them that they could return to
in recurring play [ 8 ]. However, the observations still show that
active exploration is not in itself a very playful activity as has been
argued in literature [37, 76].

It is also important to note that there already exist a variety of
interactive play equipment for outdoor installation, and that this
study was limited to a small number of installations. Hence, it is
possible that other interactive installations could offer richer forms
of engagement. However, the installations were all designed to
offer open-ended interaction, they were placed to provide links to
and inspire play in nature, and one of them (the Tube installation)
was designed to be used together with nature materials. These
design choices were deliberate attempts to support integration
into nature-rich settings. This stands in contrast with how most
standard outdoor interactive installations are designed to support
competitive play and physical exertion [ 65 ]. Hence, the effects that
were observed in this study are likely to be present, and even more
pronounced, with more standard digital installations.


**7** **Conclusions**


We performed a study of children’s self-directed play in areas with
access to both nature and digital installations. Our findings show
that play with nature materials and standard play equipment on the
one hand, and digital installations on the other, emerged in _different_
ways. Most notably, imaginative play was observed emerging in
close interaction with nature, while rule-based play emerged in
relation to the digital installations. Furthermore, there was a dif­
ference in how the digital installations typically involved children
in active exploration of their specific functions, whereas nature
materials involved children in more joyous sensory engagement,
including collecting and tasting. This engagement paved way for
widely mobile and elaborate play episodes where children made
use of their imagination.

Our study contributes with an empirically grounded analysis of
how digital installations influence children’s play in nature-rich
environments. As discussed in the background, the health and prosocial benefits of play in nature have been observed with children
engaging on their own terms. We propose a set of design opportu­
nities for the design of future digital installations and other digital

technologies for nature-rich settings, that potentially can provide
better integration with children’s self-directed play in nature.
