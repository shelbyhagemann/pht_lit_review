    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study in question focuses on the co-design of a tangible device that provides entertainment and opportunities for social engagement for one non-verbal adult participant with intellectual disability. The authors emphasize the importance of designing for one, rather than trying to create universal designs that can be used by most people. They argue that this approach is more effective in meeting the distinct needs of individuals with profound disabilities. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study, as it involves a design workshop with diverse stakeholders, including disabled individuals, to create a device that is both fun and useful."
  },
  {
    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "The study involved co-design sessions with the participant to create a sensory musical blanket, which suggests that the design process had some structure but also allowed for flexibility and creativity. The use of prototypes and iterative design process further indicates that the design was flexible and adaptable based on John's preferences and needs. While the study did not involve unstructured play or rigid game-like activities, it incorporated elements of semi-structured play and improv to create a unique and personalized design experience for John. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The passage suggests that designing technology for one participant ensures engagement with assistive technology, but not necessarily inclusive technology. This implies that the design is not entirely skill-based or chance-based, but rather a combination of both. The author mentions that highly customised systems are beneficial for people with profound disabilities, which suggests that the design is tailored to the individual's needs and abilities. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely solo (i.e., solitaire),\n    (2) mostly solo (i.e., playing against AI in single-player StarCraft),\n    (3) mix of solo and social affordances (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (4) mostly social, but aspects are independent (i.e., house on hill haunt transition),\n    (5) entirely social (i.e., tag)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design as being co-designed with one participant, which suggests that it was not entirely solo or played against AI. Additionally, the study mentions that the design method and unique interactions are key contributions of this research, which suggests that the design had both solo and social affordances."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the passage, it is mentioned that the design was designed to be deliberately playful and provide expressive representation through music. It also states that the blanket was designed to be ambiguous enough to foster flexible interactions, which allowed participants to generate new interaction scenarios. This suggests that the design allowed for some level of flexibility in terms of when actions could be taken, rather than being strictly turn-based or following a set of steps."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely synchronous (i.e., real time strategy game),\n    (2) mostly synchronous with a few asynchronous affordances (i.e., league of legends),\n    (3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances (i.e., helldivers 2),\n    (4) mostly asynchronous with few synchronous affordances (i.e. cookie clicker),\n    (5) entirely asynchronous (i.e., chess by postage mail)",
    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves participants playing a game together in real-time, but also includes elements of both synchronous and asynchronous interactions. For example, the game is designed to be played with a physical button that one participant presses to indicate their choice, which is then displayed on a screen for all participants to see. This creates a mix of synchronous (real-time) and asynchronous (not in real-time) affordances, as the participants are not necessarily playing the game at the same time but are still able to interact with each other through the physical button. Therefore, option (3) is the best answer."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely competitive (i.e., spit card game),\n    (2) mostly competitive, but sometimes collaboration is important (i.e., forbidden island),\n    (3) mix of competitive and collaborative (i.e., mario party 2 vs 2 mini-games),\n    (4) mostly collaborative (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (5) entirely collaborative (i.e., pandemic)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the participants creating games silently and organically, and competing to see who could press their button first to get their favorite song snippet played in its entirety. This suggests that there was a mix of competitive and collaborative elements in the design, as the participants were competing against each other while also working together to create games."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the context involves co-designing a sensory musical blanket with minimally verbal children on the autism spectrum. The design of the blanket is intended to be flexible and adaptable to different interactions, allowing participants to generate new interaction scenarios. This indicates that the design is neither entirely symmetrical (as there is no one \"right\" way to use the blanket) nor entirely asymmetrical (as there are multiple ways to use it), but rather a combination of both."

    "question": "How would you classify the experiential play value? Do not add additional context or reasoning in your response: \n    sensority (i.e. kaleidoscope, experiencing art), \n    fantasy (i.e. role-playing), \n    construction (i.e. music, painting, building), \n    challenge (testing physical or mental abilities against others or self), \n    undisclosed/unknown, but the paper does include a game/play system or experience, \n    not applicable",
    "answer": "Construction",
    "reasoning": "The study involved designing and co-designing a tangible device for entertainment and social engagement with a non-verbal adult participant with intellectual disability. This suggests that the focus was on creating something that could be physically manipulated or constructed, such as music, painting, or building, rather than purely sensory experiences like kaleidoscopes or fantasy role-playing. The use of a game/play system or experience also supports this classification."

    "answer": "The interview methodology used in the study was a combination of structured and semi-structured interviews.",
    "reasoning": "The authors of the study mention that they used a \"mixed-methods approach\" which involves combining both structured and semi-structured interviews to gather data from participants (Andradi et al., 2021, p. 4). A structured interview is characterized by a fixed set of questions that are asked in the same order for every participant, while a semi-structured interview allows for more flexibility and spontaneity in the conversation between the interviewer and participant (Krueger, 1994). By combining these two approaches, the researchers were able to gather both quantitative and qualitative data from their participants."
