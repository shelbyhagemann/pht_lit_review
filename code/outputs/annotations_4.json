    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(2) Mostly fun first",
    "reasoning": "The study focused on creating a game that is accessible and enjoyable for people with disabilities, as well as non-disabled users. The participants were unanimous in their feedback that the system provides sufficient feedback in a timely manner, without any distracting or unnecessary information. This suggests that the design prioritized fun and enjoyment over pure utility or functionality. Additionally, the study included two participants with no gaming experience, which further supports the conclusion that fun was a primary consideration in the design."

  {
    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, the design of the study is best described as having a flexible structure with rules. The participants were given feedback in a timely manner, and the system produced no distracting or unnecessary information. However, there was also a beep to indicate when a mistake was made, which could be seen as a form of structure. Additionally, the passage mentions that the system had built-in accessibility features, indicating that the rules were flexible enough to accommodate different levels of impairment. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves a mix of skills and chance elements. While the participants were required to press the correct drum at the right time to get a score, there was an element of chance in terms of when the beep would occur and how quickly the participants had to react. Additionally, the threshold for hearing the beep was set at 500 ms, which could be challenging for some participants, particularly those who are not experienced with playing rhythm games. Therefore, while skill is certainly a factor in the design, there is also an element of chance and luck involved."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely solo (i.e., solitaire),\n    (2) mostly solo (i.e., playing against AI in single-player StarCraft),\n    (3) mix of solo and social affordances (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (4) mostly social, but aspects are independent (i.e., house on hill haunt transition),\n    (5) entirely social (i.e., tag)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the study, the game design incorporates both solo and social elements. The participants were unanimous that the system provides sufficient feedback in a timely manner, which suggests that the game is not entirely solo or mostly solo. Additionally, the study included two participants with no gaming experience, which further supports the conclusion that the game has a mix of solo and social affordances. While the game may have some independent aspects (e.g., the beep for mistakes), the overall design seems to prioritize both solo and social elements."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) Turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves providing vibrating pulses to the participants in a random and unpredictable manner, requiring them to react quickly to the sensation. This suggests that the game is not entirely turn-based, as there is no predictability to when the next pulse will occur. Additionally, the study does not involve following a set of steps (option (2)) or entirely simultaneous play (option (5)), as the participants are responding to individual pulses in real-time. The design is closer to option (3), where turns are taken, but some actions (in this case, pressing the button in response to the vibration) can be taken at any time once the previous turn has been completed."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely synchronous (i.e., real time strategy game),\n    (2) mostly synchronous with a few asynchronous affordances (i.e., league of legends),\n    (3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances (i.e., helldivers 2),\n    (4) mostly asynchronous with few synchronous affordances (i.e. cookie clicker),\n    (5) entirely asynchronous (i.e., chess by postage mail)",
    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the study, it appears that the game design provides a mix of both synchronous and asynchronous affordances. The participants were given a one-inch button to press in response to vibrating pulses, which suggests that there is a direct physical action required of the participant in real-time. However, the use of vibrating pulses as a feedback mechanism also implies that the game provides asynchronous feedback, as the participants do not have to respond immediately to the stimulus but can take their time to react. This mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances is consistent with games like Helldivers 2, which offer a combination of fast-paced action and strategic planning."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely competitive (i.e., spit card game),\n    (2) mostly competitive, but sometimes collaboration is important (i.e., forbidden island),\n    (3) mix of competitive and collaborative (i.e., mario party 2 vs 2 mini-games),\n    (4) mostly collaborative (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (5) entirely collaborative (i.e., pandemic)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves participants playing a computer game that is designed to assess their cognitive abilities, particularly their reaction time. While the game provides feedback and rewards for correct responses, it also includes a beeping sound that signals an incorrect response. Based on the language used in the passage, it appears that the game is designed to require both competitive and collaborative elements, as participants are working together to achieve a common goal (accurately pressing the buttons) while also competing against each other for individual rewards and recognition. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

  {
    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves presenting two songs with a similar number of drumbeats per minute, but the participants were not aware of which song they were listening to. This means that the game was not entirely symmetrical, as the participants had different information to process and respond to in each trial. However, the game also had some elements of symmetry, such as the consistent structure of the songs and the fact that the beeps were always given in a timely manner. Therefore, the design can be classified as both symmetrical and asymmetrical."

    "question": "How would you classify the experiential play value? Do not add additional context or reasoning in your response: \n    sensority (i.e. kaleidoscope, experiencing art), \n    fantasy (i.e. role-playing), \n    construction (i.e. music, painting, building), \n    challenge (testing physical or mental abilities against others or self), \n    undisclosed/unknown, but the paper does include a game/play system or experience, \n    not applicable",
    "answer": "Construction",
    "reasoning": "The paper discusses the development of accessible computer games for individuals with no or limited vision, and how these games can provide experiential play value through construction. The authors mention that games and play in general are important for developing, learning, and practicing different skills, and that advances in social and multiplayer games have made it possible to connect with other people. This suggests that the experiential play value of these games is focused on construction, as they allow players to create and build things within the game."
