    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first",
    "reasoning": "The study emphasizes the importance of considering both fun and utility in the design process. The authors note that while universal design principles can provide a good starting point, adaptations beyond universal design will be necessary for each new combination of disabilities. This suggests that the design process should prioritize both fun and utility from the outset, rather than focusing solely on one or the other. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of involving disabled stakeholders in the design process to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account. By prioritizing both fun and utility, the design can be more inclusive and accessible for a diverse range of users."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the makerspace design as being ideal for a \"fully-integrated design process\" and highlights the importance of adaptations beyond universal design to accommodate different combinations of disabilities. This suggests that while universal design principles are a good starting point, the design must be flexible and adaptable to meet the unique needs of each individual. The use of the term \"design cycle\" and the emphasis on \"learning new skills is ongoing\" also suggest a more structured approach to design and problem-solving, rather than unstructured play or semi-structured activities. Additionally, the study mentions the importance of \"building infrastructure,\" which implies that there are specific elements of the design that are being addressed, such as storage, tools, and transportation, which are not typically found in unstructured play or semi-structured activities."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The study's design can be classified as equally skill and chance-based because it involves a mix of both skills and luck. While the participants' backgrounds and experiences play a significant role in shaping their perspectives on makerspaces, there is also an element of chance involved in the way they interact with the spaces and each other. For example, the participants' level of comfort with technology, their prior experience with makerspaces, and their cultural backgrounds can all impact their perceptions of these spaces. However, the study also involves activities that are more dependent on luck, such as the card game \"Mario Kart,\" which is largely based on chance rather than skill. Therefore, the design can be classified as equally skill and chance-based."
