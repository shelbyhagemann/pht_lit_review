    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first",
    "reasoning": "The study emphasizes the importance of considering both fun and utility in the design process. The authors note that while universal design principles are a good starting point, they may not be sufficient for addressing the diverse needs of people with disabilities. They suggest that a combination of both fun and utility is necessary to create accessible designs that can be used by a wide range of people. The study's methodology also reflects this approach, as it involves working with disabled stakeholders to identify their needs and preferences. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

  {
    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(5) game with rigid rules",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage is focused on designing a makerspace that is accessible and inclusive for people of all abilities. The authors mention the importance of universal design principles, which are guidelines for designing spaces and products that can be used by as many people as possible without adaptation. However, they also recognize that adaptations beyond universal design will be required for each new combination of disabilities. This suggests that the design of the makerspace is not completely unstructured or free-form, but rather has a set of rules and guidelines that are flexible enough to accommodate different needs and abilities. Therefore, option (5) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The study focuses on makers who adapt tools and technologies for their own use and for others, including for activities of daily living. This suggests that the design is not entirely skill-based, as it requires a combination of technical skills and adaptability to accommodate different abilities and needs. Additionally, the study mentions participants adapting tools for hobbies, artistic pursuits, and activities of daily living, which further supports the notion that the design is equally skill and chance-based."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely solo (i.e., solitaire),\n    (2) mostly solo (i.e., playing against AI in single-player StarCraft),\n    (3) mix of solo and social affordances (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (4) mostly social, but aspects are independent (i.e., house on hill haunt transition),\n    (5) entirely social (i.e., tag)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the study, it appears that the design is intended to provide both solo and social experiences for players. The term \"heterogenous space\" is used to describe the makerspace, which suggests that it is designed to be inclusive of people with different abilities and needs. The study notes that people with multiple disabilities have a more difficult time connecting with existing maker communities, even online, and that additional resources will be required to recruit them. This suggests that the design may need to accommodate a range of accessibility needs in order to be inclusive. Additionally, the study mentions \"bespoke design vs. universal design,\" which implies that the design is tailored to meet the specific needs of each player, rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design methodology used in the development of custom devices for upper-limb prosthetics users. The methodology involves a \"fail fast and often\" approach, where designers quickly prototype and test their ideas to identify potential solutions. This approach is different from the more conservative approach preferred by clinicians, who may be hesitant to adopt new technologies without sufficient evidence of their effectiveness. The study highlights the need for published research into the effectiveness of custom devices in AT, or the speed to market of co-designed engineer/clinician devices, as well as research on the success of individuals involved in designing their own solutions. These factors suggest that the design methodology used in the study involves a combination of turn-taking and simultaneous action-taking, rather than being entirely turn-based or following a set of steps."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a makerspace that incorporates both digital and physical spaces, with the goal of providing accessible making experiences for people with disabilities. The authors identify ways in which hybrid digital-physical spaces can be used to leverage the advantages of both, such as allowing users to work on complex projects without being tied to a single location or time. This suggests that the design is not entirely synchronous (like real-time strategy games), nor is it entirely asynchronous (like chess by postage mail), but rather has a mix of both synchronous and asynchronous affordances."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves a co-design process where participants work together to create makerspaces that are accessible and inclusive. While there is a focus on competition in some aspects, such as the \"brave space\" vs \"safe space\" subtheme, the majority of the projects involve a mix of competitive and collaborative elements. The passage highlights the importance of both individual expertise and collaboration among participants, suggesting that the design is not entirely competitive (option 1) or entirely collaborative (option 5), but rather a mix of both."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves the design of a game that is both symmetrical and asymmetrical. On one hand, the game has a similar turn structure for all players, which makes it symmetrical. On the other hand, each player has unique abilities and behaviors, which makes it asymmetrical. This blend of symmetry and asymmetry allows for a more diverse and challenging gameplay experience."
