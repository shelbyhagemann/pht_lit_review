    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study design described in the passage prioritizes both fun and utility from the beginning of the game development process. The researchers identify the needs of their participant and then choose a set of games that provide physical and motor challenges similar to those they would suggest in standard occupational therapy exercises. This suggests that the design is focused on creating a game that is both enjoyable and therapeutic, rather than prioritizing one aspect over the other."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules",
    "reasoning": "The study involved designing motion-assessing games for unsupervised home use, and the authors identified important game attributes based on limitations related to stroke. They sought to sample the design space of games according to those attributes, which suggests a more structured approach than (1) unstructured play or (2) semi-structured play. However, the games were not highly rigid like (4) flexible games with house rules, but rather had a flexible structure with rules that could be tailored to the participant's needs and abilities. This is in line with (3) flexible structure with rules."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "The study mentioned in the passage involves using games to assess motor abilities in stroke survivors, and it is noted that the design of the games can influence the quality of the data collected for assessment purposes. The games used in the study include Pong, Baseball Catch, Helicopter, Mario Kart, and Uno. While some of these games may be more skill-based than chance-based, the passage suggests that the design of the games is equally skill and chance-based, as the number of repetitions performed daily and the variation in motion precision were measured. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study developed a game infrastructure that allowed the participant to play games independently at home, but also provided opportunities for social interaction through the use of multiplayer games. The design incorporated both solo and social affordances, allowing the participant to choose how they wanted to play and interact with others. This is consistent with the definition of a mix of solo and social affordances."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study mentions that the player has a predictable goal and that incorporating explicit rest periods may still be of value, but avoiding implicit rest periods is important. This suggests that the game is not entirely turn-based (option 1), as there are opportunities for players to take actions at any time. However, it is not entirely simultaneous (option 5) either, as there are turns taken and actions can be taken out of turn. Instead, the game follows a set of steps (option 2), with some actions being taken at any time within those steps."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the context provided, the study involved designing games for unsupervised home use with the goal of improving motion skills in participants. The authors identified important game attributes related to stroke limitations and sought to sample the design space of games according to those attributes. They also noted that future games should make a greater effort to fully separate measurements of motion improvements from other potential factors, such as cognitive improvements and increased familiarity with games. This suggests that the study involved a mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances in the designed games, rather than a single type of game design."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study mentioned in the passage involves designing games for stroke rehabilitation, and the authors identify a need to focus on positives rather than negatives and promote collaboration rather than competition. They also mention that networked games can help lessen social isolation following a stroke. These suggestions suggest that the design of the games is intended to provide a mix of competitive and collaborative elements, rather than being entirely competitive or entirely collaborative."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves designing games for therapeutic motions, specifically focusing on comparing the amount of therapy delivered through a motion-based game versus a more traditional therapy context. The authors acknowledge that the motions within a game may not be directly comparable to those in a clinical therapy session, as they may only require the player to move through a part of their range. However, the study aims to determine ways to enhance game designs to improve the data collected for analysis and increase the therapeutic value of in-game motions."

    "answer": "Case study.",
    "reasoning": "The paper describes a case study where the authors conducted semistructured interviews with a participant before, during, and after a six-week home study to gather data about the participant's experiences. This method allows for an in-depth exploration of a single individual or group's experiences and behaviors, which is typical of a case study."

    "answer": "Semi-structured interview.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the passage, it is clear that the interviews conducted during the home study were not structured interviews, as they were described as \"semistructured.\" Additionally, the passage mentions that the interviews were conducted in a weekly meeting format, which suggests a degree of structure and repetition in the questions asked. However, the passage also notes that the interviews allowed for flexibility and exploration of new topics, which is consistent with a semi-structured interview approach. Therefore, the answer is (B) Semi-structured interview."

    "reasoning": "Based on the context provided, it seems that the workshop methodologies used were a combination of those listed above. The occupational therapy researcher took an iterative participatory design approach to develop games for motion assessment, which involved identifying requirements through home visits and interviews with participants (action research), involving participants in the design process through methods such as role-playing and scenario development (cooperative method development), and using speculative design techniques to create innovative solutions (speculative design). Additionally, they used various other methods such as affinity diagramming, ideation, user journey mapping, brainstorming, bodystorming, design probes, prototyping, and mock-ups to develop and refine the game systems."

    "answer": "Motor of physical impairment.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, the community of focus is motor of physical impairment. The participant experienced hemiparesis, which is a partial paralysis of one side of the body, resulting in limitations in fine motor control, strength, and range of motion. This is an example of a physical impairment that affects the ability to perform certain tasks."

    "answer": "**4. Participatory Design with Stakeholders with Disabilities**",
    "reasoning": "The study involved participants with stroke who were involved in the participatory design process, which means they had an active role in shaping the content and process of rehabilitation. The authors noted that their participants lived in houses that are not ideal for their condition, and technology can help with their everyday activities. Therefore, it is likely that user involvement was a key aspect of the study, particularly in involving stakeholders with disabilities in the participatory design process."
