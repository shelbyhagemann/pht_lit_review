    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study aimed to design a game that is accessible and enjoyable for children with visual impairments, while also providing educational value. The design process involved seeking input from families of children with visual impairments through an online survey and user testing with sighted children. The results suggest that the design should prioritize both fun and utility, as participants preferred games that were both enjoyable and provided educational value. This approach aligns with the concept of \"serious play,\" which emphasizes the importance of play in learning and problem-solving. By incorporating both fun and utility elements, the game can cater to a diverse range of stakeholders and provide a more inclusive gaming experience for children with visual impairments."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules",
    "reasoning": "The study involved testing the interface of a tool for sighted children who had played Minecraft, and the participants were asked to build in creative mode either on their own or with a partner. This suggests that the design was semi-structured, as there were no rigid rules but rather flexible structures that allowed for creativity and collaboration. The use of the term \"creative mode\" also implies that the goal was to encourage creativity and self-expression, rather than structured play or competitive gameplay."

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the text involves designing a game that is accessible to a wide range of players, including those with disabilities. The authors cite several sources that suggest games can be designed to be either skill-based or chance-based, but they argue that the most inclusive designs are those that combine both elements. This is because games that rely solely on skill can be difficult for players who may not have the necessary abilities, while games that rely solely on chance can be frustrating for players who feel they have no control over their outcome. By combining both skill and chance elements, designers can create a more inclusive and engaging experience for all players."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "Based on the literature and survey results, the design goals of the study were focused on providing non-visual feedback regarding the Minecraft world, allowing users to build constructions using tangible objects, and promoting collaboration between mixed ability users. The study tested the interface with sighted children who had played Minecraft, and participants built in creative mode either on their own or with a partner. This suggests that the design included both solo and social affordances, as users were able to play independently or with a partner. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design as using a 3x3 grid of vibration motors that sit along the forearm, and participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire including the System Usability Scale (SUS). This suggests that the game is not entirely turn-based, as players would need to take actions at different times, but also allows for some flexibility in when players can take their turns. The study also mentions that users had difficulty recognizing more than two motors vibrating simultaneously, which further supports the idea that the game is not entirely simultaneous."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the game as providing \"non-visual feedback regarding the Minecraft world\" and allowing users to \"build constructions in the Minecraft world using tangible objects.\" These features suggest that the game has both synchronous (real-time) and asynchronous (offline) elements, as players can build and explore the Minecraft world at their own pace. The study also mentions the importance of collaboration between mixed ability users, which further supports the idea that the game is designed with a mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves designing a tactile interface for Minecraft to enable blind and visually impaired players to play the game. The authors note that while Minecraft is primarily designed for visual input, it can be challenging for blind and visually impaired players to navigate and build in the game. To address this challenge, they propose a tactile interface that allows players to build and navigate using tactile feedback."
