    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the study's focus on understanding the motivations of sports fans and the types of technology that could increase their accessibility to watching sports, it is likely that the design of the study was intended to be both fun and utilitarian for the participants. The study used all eight motivations from the Sport Fan Motivation Scales, with Entertainment and Eustress being the highest motivations, and Economic and Escape being the lowest. This suggests that the design of the study was intended to cater to a wide range of motivations and preferences among sports fans. Additionally, two participants mentioned that they enjoy socialization (Affiliation and Family Needs), which further supports the idea that the design of the study was intended to be both fun and utilitarian."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(4) Flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules)",
    "reasoning": "Based on the context provided, it appears that the study is focused on exploring how technology can increase the accessibility of watching sports for individuals with disabilities. The participants in the study mentioned various ways in which they would like to see technology improve their ability to watch sports, such as play-by-play descriptions and in-person game experiences. However, the study did not specifically mention any particular type of game or structure that would be most accessible for individuals with disabilities. Therefore, option (4) Flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules) is the most applicable answer. This type of game allows for flexibility and creativity in terms of gameplay and rules, which could potentially make it more accessible for individuals with disabilities who may have different needs and preferences."

    "answer": "(4) mostly chance-based",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it is clear that sports fans watch sports for a variety of reasons, including entertainment, eustress, and socialization. However, when asked to describe themselves as a sports fan, the majority of participants (34.9%) identified as \"Local,\" meaning they like watching games of specific teams. This suggests that while there may be some skill involved in playing sports, the enjoyment of watching sports is largely dependent on chance and luck, rather than purely skill-based. Therefore, option (4) mostly chance-based best describes the design of the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely solo (i.e., solitaire),\n    (2) mostly solo (i.e., playing against AI in single-player StarCraft),\n    (3) mix of solo and social affordances (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (4) mostly social, but aspects are independent (i.e., house on hill haunt transition),\n    (5) entirely social (i.e., tag)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves in-person games, which provide a social atmosphere for fans to gather and enjoy the game together. However, the motivations listed in the passage suggest that participants also enjoy sports for individual reasons such as entertainment, escape, and learning strategy and statistics. Therefore, the design can be classified as having both solo and social affordances, with a mix of the two."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The passage describes the participants in the study as wanting to know who gets the ball, who makes the touchdown, and who is running, indicating that they want to have a more interactive experience while watching sports. However, the technology used in the study allows for some actions to be taken at any time, rather than being strictly turn-based or following a set of steps. This suggests that the design of the study was more flexible and allowed for a mix of both turn-taking and simultaneous actions."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely synchronous (i.e., real time strategy game),\n    (2) mostly synchronous with a few asynchronous affordances (i.e., league of legends),\n    (3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances (i.e., helldivers 2),\n    (4) mostly asynchronous with few synchronous affordances (i.e. cookie clicker),\n    (5) entirely asynchronous (i.e., chess by postage mail)",
    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the study, it appears that the participants were watching sports games in real-time, but also had the ability to listen to radio broadcasts of the game at a delayed time. This allows for a mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances, as the participants could watch the game in real-time but also listen to a delayed broadcast. This is similar to the design of games like Helldivers 2, which offer both real-time and asynchronous elements to the gameplay experience."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves designing a sports game that is both competitive and collaborative. The participants mentioned play-by-play descriptions, which suggests that they want to know who gets the ball, who makes the touchdown, and who is running, indicating a competitive aspect of the game. However, the study also mentions that participants want to socialize with other fans, friends, and family, which suggests a collaborative aspect of the game. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study, as it involves a mix of competitive and collaborative elements."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the participants as enjoying in-person games for various reasons, such as the atmosphere, crowds, cheers, weather, food, and drinks. However, they also mention that play-by-play descriptions are important for them to enjoy watching sports. This suggests that while there may be some symmetry in the design of the study (e.g., all participants were asked the same questions), there are also elements that are unique to each individual's experience (e.g., their personal preferences and reasons for watching sports). Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "question": "How would you classify the experiential play value? Do not add additional context or reasoning in your response: \n    sensority (i.e. kaleidoscope, experiencing art), \n    fantasy (i.e. role-playing), \n    construction (i.e. music, painting, building), \n    challenge (testing physical or mental abilities against others or self), \n    undisclosed/unknown, but the paper does include a game/play system or experience, \n    not applicable",
    "answer": "Construction",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be seen that the participants enjoy watching sports for various reasons such as the atmosphere, crowds, cheers, weather, food and drinks, socialization with other fans, friends, and family. This suggests that the experience of watching sports is more than just a simple form of entertainment, but rather a multi-sensory experience that engages multiple aspects of one's being. The passage mentions that participants enjoy \"eating good food and feeling the air,\" which further reinforces this interpretation. Therefore, it can be classified as a construction play value, which involves creating or experiencing something through multiple senses and emotions."
