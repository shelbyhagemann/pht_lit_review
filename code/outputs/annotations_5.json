    "answer": "(4) flexible game",
    "reasoning": "The study used the Design Box method, which is a structured design process that involves a series of inductive ideation sessions with different stakeholders. The method encourages participants to generate and evaluate ideas in a flexible and iterative manner. While the study involved some structure in terms of the activities and tasks undertaken during the ideation sessions, the overall design process was described as \"flexible\" and \"empower[ing] participants to have a range of control over the experience.\" This suggests that the design process was more focused on generating and evaluating ideas than on following a strict set of rules or guidelines. Therefore, option (4) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study used the Design Box method, which involves a combination of individual ideation sessions with the research team, development team, and medical provider stakeholders, as well as group sessions with individuals with SCI/D and individuals with tetraplegia participating in adaptive recreation camps. This suggests that the design process involved a mix of solo and social affordances, as it incorporated both individual and group input. Additionally, the study aimed to accommodate a wide range of physical abilities and prior skiing experience, which further supports the idea that the design had a mix of solo and social affordances."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that the design of Tetra-Ski involves taking turns to control the skis, but also allows for some actions to be taken at any time during the turn. For example, the passage mentions that users can perform a single _Sip_ or _Puff_ to turn all the way left or right, and a _SipPuff_ command would stop the turning of the skis. This suggests that there are some actions that can be taken at any time during the turn, rather than having to wait for a specific phase or turn. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely synchronous (i.e., real time strategy game),\n    (2) mostly synchronous with a few asynchronous affordances (i.e., league of legends),\n    (3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances (i.e., helldivers 2),\n    (4) mostly asynchronous with few synchronous affordances (i.e. cookie clicker),\n    (5) entirely asynchronous (i.e., chess by postage mail)",
    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study used a mixed bag of qualitative and quantitative tools to capture a rich view of the design process. They collected performance data in real-time during the simulation, which suggests that the design is not entirely synchronous as it would require all participants to be online at the same time. However, there are also asynchronous affordances in the design as users can complete tasks at their own pace. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative",
    "reasoning": "The study used the Design Box method, which involves a series of inductive ideation sessions with different stakeholders, including the research team, development team, medical provider stakeholders, individuals with SCI/D, and individuals with tetraplegia participating in adaptive recreation camps. This suggests that the design process involved a mix of competitive and collaborative elements, as different groups were involved in the ideation sessions. Additionally, the study mentioned that ski trainers and professional skiers provided input on the design, which further supports the idea that the design was a mix of competitive and collaborative elements."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study used a combination of symmetric and asymmetric elements in the design of the Tetra-Ski simulation. While the simulation itself was designed to be symmetric, with all participants receiving the same training and using the same equipment, the adaptive nature of the game allowed for individualized challenges and experiences based on each participant's abilities and preferences. This blend of symmetry and asymmetry in the design allows for a more inclusive and personalized experience for players with spinal cord injuries or tetraplegia."
