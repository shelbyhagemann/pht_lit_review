    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first",
    "reasoning": "The study's design involved working with a diverse group of stakeholders, including participants with no gaming experience, to create an accessible and inclusive game. While the primary mechanic was designed with accessibility in mind, the focus was on creating a fun and engaging experience for all participants. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage focuses on the design of a computer game that is accessible to individuals with visual impairments. The participants were unanimous in their assessment that the system provides sufficient feedback in a timely manner, and there was no distracting or unnecessary information produced by the system. This suggests that the game had a flexible structure with rules, allowing for a balance between challenge and accessibility. Additionally, the study mentions built-in accessibility features such as tactile feedback, which further supports the conclusion that the game had a flexible structure with rules."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The study's design involves a game that requires players to hit the correct drum in response to a beep, with a time limit to react after vibration. While some participants found the beep distracting, others appreciated the feedback it provided. This suggests that the game is neither entirely skill-based (as players would need to rely solely on their reflexes) nor entirely chance-based (as the outcome would be completely random), but rather a mix of both skill and chance. The ESC function provided in the system allows expert users to skip the instruction, indicating that the game is flexible and efficient for different types of players. However, some novice users found the 500 ms threshold too short, suggesting that they may need more support to continue playing the game comfortably."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the study, the game Rock Vibe offers both solo and social affordances. The participants were unanimous that the system provides sufficient feedback in a timely manner, and there was no distracting or unnecessary information produced by the system. However, the study did not test the multiplayer function of Rock Vibe, which would have allowed the user group to take full advantage of social games for connecting with other people, sighted and non-sighted. Therefore, the game design can be classified as a mix of solo and social affordances, as it provides both single-player and multiplayer options."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the study, it appears that the design is a hybrid of turn-based and real-time elements. The participants were given ten trials to perform, with each trial consisting of a sequence of cues (such as vibrating pulses or beeps) that they had to respond to in a timely manner. However, the study did not use a traditional turn-based system where players take turns making moves, rather it used a combination of pre-determined cues and real-time feedback to guide the participants' actions. This is consistent with the description of the design as (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the study, it appears that the game design provides a mix of both synchronous and asynchronous affordances. The participants were placed in a chair facing a one-inch button, and the wrist strap provided randomly occurring vibrating pulses to the skin of the participants. This suggests that the game has both immediate and delayed feedback mechanisms, as the vibrations are not necessarily delivered in real-time but rather at random intervals. Additionally, the fact that the participants were able to respond to the vibration by pressing the button suggests that there is a degree of asynchronous interaction possible within the game. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the context provides a mixed design where participants played both competitive and collaborative games. For example, the game \"Aesthetic and Minimalist Design\" involved participants playing a card game where they had to click on the correct color card as quickly as possible, but also involved collaboration through the use of a beep sound to indicate when a mistake was made. This mix of competitive and collaborative elements is consistent with option (3)."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study designed a game that had both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements. On one hand, the game provided consistent visual cues for the drumbeats, which is a symmetrical aspect of the design. However, the study also introduced different NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs, which introduces an element of asymmetry into the game. This means that the game is not entirely symmetrical (option 1), nor is it entirely asymmetrical (option 5), but rather a combination of both."
