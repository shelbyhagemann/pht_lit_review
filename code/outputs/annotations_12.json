    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study's design involves a mix of both fun and utility aspects. The participants were asked to enjoy sports as entertainment and recreation, but also to think about the team's success as their own success, which suggests that there is an element of utility involved. Additionally, the study used all eight motivations from the Sport Fan Motivation Scales, with Entertainment and Eustress being the highest and lowest respectively, indicating that the design was intended to cater to both fun and utility aspects."

    "answer": "(4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules)",
    "reasoning": "Based on the context of the study, it is clear that the participants value the social aspect of watching sports in-person and enjoy the atmosphere, crowds, cheers, weather, food, and drinks. They also want to be able to understand what is happening during the game, which suggests that they prefer a flexible game with house rules rather than an unstructured play or semi-structured play. Improv and video games are not mentioned in the context, so they cannot be the best answer. Flexible structure with rules, while possible, is not explicitly mentioned in the passage either, so it is also not the best answer."

    "answer": "(3) Equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the study is equally skill and chance-based. The participants mentioned that they need play-by-play descriptions to enjoy watching sports more, which suggests that there is a level of skill involved in understanding the game. However, the passage also mentions that sports statistics are often complicated with lots of data, which implies that there is an element of chance involved in accessing and analyzing the information. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves both in-person and online components, allowing participants to engage in sports viewing either solo or with others. While the majority of the motivations for watching sports are related to entertainment and enjoyment, some participants also mentioned enjoying the social aspect of watching sports with friends and family. Therefore, the design can be classified as having a mix of solo and social affordances, as it caters to both individual preferences and social interactions."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it is clear that the study involved designing a system for watching sports that takes into account the needs and preferences of participants with visual impairments. The participants were asked about their preferences regarding the accessibility of watching sports, and they mentioned that they need play-by-play descriptions to enjoy watching sports more. This suggests that the design involved providing real-time descriptions of the action on the field, which can be taken at any time during the game. The passage does not mention any other elements of turn-based or simultaneous games, such as set steps or phases, that would suggest a different design approach. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the study, it appears that the design is an equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances. While some participants enjoy the in-person atmosphere and socialization with other fans, friends, and family, others find it too noisy and expensive. Additionally, many participants struggle to understand what's happening in the game due to a lack of description and noisy environments, leading them to ask their companions for explanations. To address this challenge, some participants listen to the radio during in-person games to get information, although the radio broadcast is often delayed by a few seconds depending on the venue."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design as a \"sports game\" where participants enjoy in-person games for the atmosphere, crowds, cheers, weather, food, and drinks, and socialization with other fans, friends, and family. However, the study also mentions that many participants shared that it was hard for them to understand what they didn't go to in-person games because it is too noisy and pricy, so they didn't rate the in-person experiences. This suggests that while there is a mix of competitive and collaborative elements in the design, the focus is more on the socialization and enjoyment of the atmosphere rather than pure competition."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the participants' preferences for play-by-play descriptions when watching sports, which suggests that they want to know who is involved in the action and what is happening. This indicates that the design of the study is both symmetrical and asymmetrical, as it includes elements of both structure (e.g., knowing who has the ball) and variability (e.g., different teams, players, and weather conditions)."

    "question": "How would you classify the experiential play value? Do not add additional context or reasoning in your response: \n    sensority (i.e. kaleidoscope, experiencing art), \n    fantasy (i.e. role-playing), \n    construction (i.e. music, painting, building), \n    challenge (testing physical or mental abilities against others or self), \n    undisclosed/unknown, but the paper does include a game/play system or experience, \n    not applicable",
    "answer": "Construction",
    "reasoning": "Based on the context provided in the paper, it appears that the experiential play value of watching sports is classified as \"construction.\" This is because the participants mentioned enjoying the atmosphere, crowds, cheers, weather, food and drinks, and socialization with other fans, friends, and family. These elements suggest a sense of creation or building something enjoyable, rather than simply experiencing something pre-existing (such as a kaleidoscope or fantasy role-playing). Additionally, the paper mentions that participants enjoy watching sports to learn strategy and statistics, which further supports the classification of construction."

They mention using the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) research mailing list, which suggests that they may have also reached out to individuals directly through email or mail. Additionally, they mention using convenience sampling, which means they likely reached out to participants who were already affiliated with the NFB. Snowball and word of mouth recruitment methods were also used, as participants were asked to invite their friends and family to participate.
