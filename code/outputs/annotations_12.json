    "answer": "I would classify the experiential play value of the Flote as construction. The Flote is a musical instrument that allows users to create music through head and neck movements, which falls under the category of construction play. The user interacts with the instrument by moving their head and neck in different ways to produce different notes, creating a musical composition. This type of play value is focused on building and creating something, rather than testing abilities or exploring fantasy worlds."
