    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves a combination of entertainment and practicality in its approach to creating a musical instrument for people with limited mobility. The use of a webcam to track the user's head movements and map them directly onto a piano keyboard is an enjoyable and interactive experience, while also providing a means for users to create music despite their limitations. This combination of fun and utility is reflected in the design approach, where both stakeholders with disabilities and design professionals are involved in the workshop setting. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "The design of the Flote, as described in the study, is intended to be an expressive instrument that can be played by individuals with limited mobility. To achieve this goal, the software simplifies the process of creating a musical instrument while maintaining full expressiveness. While some aspects of the design may rely on skill (such as selecting notes and manipulating them), other aspects involve chance (such as randomizing the range of movement). Therefore, the best answer is (3) equally skill and chance-based."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a musical instrument for people with limited mobility, which allows users to create music through a combination of solo and social interactions. The design includes features such as a vertical or horizontal range of movement, and mapping the range of linear movement onto the scale of playable notes. This suggests that the design is intended to be used by multiple users in different ways, with some aspects being independent (such as the user's range of motion) while others are social (such as playing against AI or other users). Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The design of the Flote system described in the study allows players to take turns, but also permits certain actions to be taken at any time during the game. For example, the player's movements directly change the pitch of the instrument in \"unlocked\" mode, but once a note has been begun, the player is free to move without changing the pitch. This allows the player to prepare for the next note while still playing the current one. Additionally, the design includes a \"mode\" checkbox that allows players to switch between two performance modes, which further supports the idea that turns are taken but some actions can be taken at any time."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely synchronous (i.e., real time strategy game),\n    (2) mostly synchronous with a few asynchronous affordances (i.e., league of legends),\n    (3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances (i.e., helldivers 2),\n    (4) mostly asynchronous with few synchronous affordances (i.e. cookie clicker),\n    (5) entirely asynchronous (i.e., chess by postage mail)",
    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The design in the study combines both synchronous and asynchronous elements, allowing users to interact with the system in both real-time and at their own pace. The use of breath control to trigger different notes suggests a level of flexibility and adaptability, but also requires the user to be in sync with the system in order to play the notes correctly. This mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances allows for a more expressive and dynamic interaction, while still maintaining a level of structure and control."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The Flote's design is a mix of both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements. On one hand, the default key and root note are fixed, which provides some symmetry in terms of the available notes and the player's range of motion. However, the ability to change the root note through the menu button and the addition of future features such as MIDI output and automatic calibration introduce asymmetrical elements that allow for a broader tonal palette and more independence for the player."
