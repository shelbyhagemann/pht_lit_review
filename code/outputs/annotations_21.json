    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage is focused on exploring the design of interactive materials and activities for children's creativity development. The researchers observed successful instructional strategies, such as providing materials that are easy to use and allowing children to explore and create freely. However, they also noted instances where instruction and designed materials led to confusion. This suggests that a flexible structure with rules, rather than an unstructured or semi-structured approach, may be most effective in promoting creativity."

    "answer": "(4) mostly chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The study involved workshops where participants were taught to assemble and program an Arduino Uno board. While the instruction provided helped participants learn how to use the hardware, the design of the circuit board and wires created confusion due to the large number of moving parts. This suggests that the success of the instruction was largely dependent on chance, as participants had to navigate a complex layout of wires and connect them correctly to the board. Therefore, option (4) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "Throughout the study, Miele directed hobbyists to turn their circuit board in a specific order and take certain actions at designated times. While there were some steps involved in the design process, such as photographing and annotating co-designed sketches, the overall design was not entirely turn-based or set to a fixed sequence of steps. Instead, participants were given nonvisually-friendly descriptions and time for tactile exploration, allowing them to take actions at their own pace within certain constraints. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design as having a \"mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances\" [1]. This suggests that the design includes both real-time and turn-based elements, allowing participants to access and maintain information at their own pace while still interacting with other participants in real-time. This is consistent with games like Helldivers 2, which combine real-time and turn-based elements to create a dynamic and responsive gameplay experience."
