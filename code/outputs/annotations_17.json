    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study involved designing a system for children with disabilities, and the participants were asked for suggestions on future developments. This suggests that both fun and utility were considered important in the design process. Additionally, the use of Thematic Analysis to extract design recommendations implies that the focus was on both functional and enjoyable aspects of the system. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves children engaging in programming activities using TIP-Toy, a block-based programming system. The children were exposed to different activities that taught them basic computational concepts and practices, and they understood the particular rules underlying the system's operation through play. The study used Thematic Analysis to extract design recommendations for the system and for the series of programming activities for children. This suggests that the design of the system was flexible and allowed for creativity and experimentation, while still providing a structure for learning and understanding programming concepts. Therefore, option (3) flexible structure with rules is the best answer."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The TIP-Toy evaluation study involved middle and high school visually impaired users, who were tested on their coding abilities using the TIP-Toy toolkit. The study found that the participants were able to use the toolkit effectively and make design recommendations based on their experiences. However, the study also noted that the toolkit was not solely skill-based, but rather had a mix of both skill and chance elements. This is because the toolkit included features such as sequences, loops, events, and data, which required the participants to use both procedural and declarative programming concepts. Therefore, option (3) equally skill and chance-based best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a hybrid programming environment that combines physical blocks with a visual interface, allowing users to switch between the two modes. The authors discuss the importance of providing support for novice users, parents, and teachers to contribute to further developments. They also acknowledge the limitations of TUIs due to their physical characteristics, but suggest that a mix of solo and social affordances could be beneficial for engaging children with more complex computational thinking tasks. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The passage describes the design of TIP-Toy, a toolkit for teaching programming concepts to young children. The system is designed to introduce four basic computational concepts (sequences, events, loops, and data) and support incremental and iterative testing and debugging practices. The passage highlights that the system allows for some actions to be taken at any time, but there are specific phases where turns are taken. This best applies to option (3), as the system has a mix of turn-based and simultaneous elements."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the design in the study, it appears that the play and variable blocks were introduced to the participants in a way that allowed for both synchronous and asynchronous interactions. The use of magnets, strings, and matching concave and convex shapes allowed for tactile distinction between different block types, which suggests a mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances. Additionally, the purpose of the research was explained to the children and accompanying adults at the start of the session, which further supports the idea that the design was intended to be a mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes TIP-Toy as a computational toolkit that is inclusive of children with different visual abilities, rather than being specifically designed for fully blind children. This suggests that the design is not entirely symmetrical, as it needs to accommodate different abilities and preferences among its users. However, the design also includes elements of symmetry, such as using diferent colors for diferent block types and high contrast to highlight the presence of dots. Therefore, the best answer is (3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical."
