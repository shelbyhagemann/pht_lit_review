    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the study, it can be inferred that the design was created with both fun and utility in mind from the start. The study involved caregivers who participated in a design workshop with disabled stakeholders, which suggests that the design was intended to be both functional and enjoyable for the target audience. Additionally, the study used a combination of usability questions (Q1-Q4) and device acceptability questions (Q5-Q8) to evaluate the design, which further supports the idea that the design was intended to be both fun and useful."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the study involves a flexible structure with rules. The therapists in the team have designed new activities based on a similar pattern of tasks, which suggests a degree of structure and organization to the play. However, the number of objects and their shape and color are more complex in the most advanced configuration, indicating that there is some flexibility in the design. Additionally, the use of a simple menu allows the therapist to configure the level of complexity of the activity, which further supports the idea of a flexible structure with rules."

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "The design in the study is best described as (3) equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the questions asked in the survey, it appears that the design of the HoloLearn system is a mix of both skill-based and chance-based elements. While some questions require users to perform specific actions with their gaze or air taps (skill-based), others involve staring at holograms or completing tasks in a specific order (chance-based). The survey results show that participants were able to complete the tasks, but there was a range of performance levels and degree of task completion. This suggests that both skill and chance played a role in their ability to use the system effectively."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the tables and the text, it appears that the design of the study involves a mix of solo and social affordances. For example, the \"Laying the table\" activity includes holographic objects that can be selected and placed by the caregiver alone or with the help of a therapist, indicating a mix of solo and social affordances. Additionally, the text mentions that new items will be added to the activity based on food type, suggesting that the design may involve a mix of solo and social tasks."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "The design of HoloLearn is closest to (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the results of the caregivers' survey in Table 3 and Table 4, it can be seen that the majority of participants in Group 1 (severity level = severe) found the interaction paradigm to be somewhat complex, with 45.5% finding it easy to use and 63.6% finding it difficult to use. However, when asked about the usability of the interaction paradigm in Table 6B, the majority of participants (83.3%) found it to be turn-based, which is consistent with the design of HoloLearn. Additionally, the fact that some actions can be taken at any time suggests that the design is not entirely turn-based, but rather follows a set of steps with some flexibility. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of HoloLearn."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the tables, it can be seen that the design of the study involves a mix of synchronous and asynchronous tasks. For example, in Table 3, the usability of the interaction paradigm is highest for question Q5, which asks caregivers to rate their satisfaction with the device's acceptability and usability. This suggests that the design includes both synchronous (real-time) and asynchronous (self-paced) tasks. Similarly, in Table 8, the task complexity is highest for question Q7, which involves a more complex task of tidying up a room. This also suggests that the design includes a mix of synchronous and asynchronous tasks. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The design of the study's interactive paradigm is a mix of both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements. On one hand, the therapist can configure the level of complexity of the activity by setting the number of people for whom the table must be prepared (up to three people), which introduces some symmetry in the design. However, the types of objects to be placed are not fixed and can vary depending on the situation, which introduces an element of asymmetry. For example, in the \"easy\" configuration, the participant is presented with basic objects such as glasses, cutlery, plates, and one bottle of water, but in a more complex configuration, the objects could be different. Therefore, the design can be classified as both symmetrical and asymmetrical."
