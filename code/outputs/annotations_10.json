    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design activity involved both fun and utility aspects. The students were engaged and invested in the design process, and the prototypes they created reflected this balance between fun and utility. The passage mentions that the students became personally invested in the design process and that the UMBC researchers presented how the designs had evolved that day, indicating a focus on both fun and utility aspects of the design. Additionally, the fact that the students were divided into small groups to work on the prototypes suggests that there was a balance between individual creativity and collaboration, which is consistent with a design approach that prioritizes both fun and utility."

    "answer": "(4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules)",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the study, it appears that the design involved creating a game with flexible rules that could be tailored to the needs and abilities of each player. The use of small, self-chosen teams and the presentation of designs evolved during the activity suggest a level of flexibility and autonomy in the design process. Additionally, the focus on accessibility and inclusivity in the study suggests that the game was designed with the goal of being accessible to a wide range of players, including those with cognitive disabilities. Therefore, option (4) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The study involved design activities that were a mix of skill-based and chance-based elements. While the app and game prototypes were working prototypes, they also included paper prototypes to cater to different learning styles and preferences. This allowed every member of the team to be hands-on during design activities, regardless of their individual strengths or difficulties. The use of both visual and verbal approaches to design further demonstrated the inclusive nature of the study. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the workshop was a mix of solo and social affordances. The students were divided into small groups for teamwork, but each student had their own individual ideas and contributions to make to the design process. Additionally, the use of both working prototypes and paper prototypes allowed for a hands-on experience for every member of the team, regardless of their preference. This mix of solo and social affordances enabled each student to feel included and invested in the design process, while also allowing for collaboration and peer instruction. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it is clear that the students were engaged and invested in the design process throughout the activity. The facilitators encouraged teamwork and allowed each student to contribute their ideas, which resulted in a more personalized and inclusive experience for all participants. The passage also mentions that the students interacted with the app and game prototypes in small, self-chosen teams, which suggests that the design was not entirely turn-based or follow a set of steps. Additionally, the fact that some actions could be taken at any time during the activity supports this answer."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the workshop involved a mix of synchronous and asynchronous activities. The students were divided into small teams and worked together to design accessible apps and games, with the guidance of UMBC researchers. This suggests that the design was not entirely synchronous, as there were opportunities for teamwork and collaboration. However, it was also not entirely asynchronous, as the students had to work together in real-time to develop their designs. Therefore, option (3) is the best answer."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative",
    "reasoning": "Based on the context provided, the design of the study involved a mix of competitive and collaborative elements. The students were divided into small groups to work together on design activities, but there was also a large group session where students contributed their ideas. Additionally, the study used both working prototypes and paper prototypes, which allowed for both individual and group participation. This mix of competitive and collaborative elements is consistent with the (3) mix of competitive and collaborative option."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the design activities in the study, it can be observed that the students were involved in both small group sessions and large group sessions, where they contributed their ideas and worked on designing a mobile app or game prototype. The use of both working prototypes and paper prototypes allowed every member of the team to be hands-on during the design activities, catering to different learning styles and preferences. This suggests that the design was a combination of both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements, with a mix of structured and unstructured components."

    "answer": "Construction",
    "reasoning": "Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the workshop involved designing and prototyping applications and games, which falls under the category of construction. The students were asked to relate the tasks to their own lives and interests, and to give feedback on how to make the apps and games more accessible for diverse users. This suggests that the workshop was focused on creating something tangible and practical, rather than purely theoretical or imaginative."
