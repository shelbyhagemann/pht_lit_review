    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(2) Mostly fun first.",
    "reasoning": "The passage highlights the importance of making composition systems accessible to people with disabilities. Two approaches have been taken by DMP to improve disabled access: adapting, extending or combining existing software and hardware, and creating bespoke solutions. The passage emphasizes the need for a \"safe\" environment where people with learning difficulties can enjoy creating music, indicating that fun is an important factor in the design process. Therefore, option (2) best applies to the design in the study, as it prioritizes fun first and involves disabled stakeholders in the design workshop."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv)",
    "reasoning": "The passage describes a design in which students are given activities to guide them through a selected compositional process, but with varying degrees of user choice and control. This allows students to learn by observing and participating in an active process, while still exercising creative freedom and making musical evaluations, decisions, and choices within the activity. This is similar to the concept of improv, where musicians create music on the spot based on a set of rules and guidelines, but with the flexibility to make changes and improvisations as they see fit. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The design in the study involves activities that allow users to make musical decisions at a high level, with minimal further user interaction required to produce musical output. This suggests that there is an element of both skill and chance involved in the activities, as users are able to make decisions that affect the outcome of the music but do not have complete control over it. This is consistent with the concept of \"equally skill and chance-based,\" which refers to designs where both skill and luck play a role in determining the outcome."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely solo (i.e., solitaire),\n    (2) mostly solo (i.e., playing against AI in single-player StarCraft),\n    (3) mix of solo and social affordances (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (4) mostly social, but aspects are independent (i.e., house on hill haunt transition),\n    (5) entirely social (i.e., tag)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study design described in the passage combines both solo and social aspects, allowing users to work independently or collaboratively on compositional tasks. The system presents a variety of activities that can be undertaken alone or with others, such as entering or processing material, choosing sounds, and constructing new activities. This mix of solo and social affordances allows users to customize their own environment and compose music within the framework of particular compositional methodologies, while also providing guidance and pathways through the compositional tasks. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely synchronous (i.e., real time strategy game),\n    (2) mostly synchronous with a few asynchronous affordances (i.e., league of legends),\n    (3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances (i.e., helldivers 2),\n    (4) mostly asynchronous with few synchronous affordances (i.e. cookie clicker),\n    (5) entirely asynchronous (i.e., chess by postage mail)",
    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design as offering \"a custom system... which allows users to try out and control complex or repetitious processes quickly and easily\" and provides examples of how this can be achieved through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous affordances. The use of the term \"equal mix\" suggests that the design intends to strike a balance between these two types of affordances, rather than leaning heavily in one direction or the other. This aligns with the definition of (3), which describes a design that offers both synchronous and asynchronous affordances in roughly equal measure."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The design of the system in the study is aimed at providing a balance between symmetry and asymmetry. While the tasks involve repetitive actions, the custom system offers more control and freedom to navigate between actions within the activity, indicating a mix of both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements. The use of intelligible menu options and reduced number of operations required for completing tasks also support this answer."
