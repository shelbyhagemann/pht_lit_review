    "answer": "(2) mostly fun first.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that the design of the system in the study prioritized fun and engagement for the users, particularly for the parents who were also given a questionnaire to gather feedback. The passage mentions that the initial prototype was developed with the intention of addressing the need for access to older narratives, as well as the desire for smaller devices with better battery power and the ability to print generated narratives. These features suggest that the design was focused on providing an enjoyable experience for the users, rather than solely prioritizing utility. Additionally, the passage notes that the development process involved working with the users and their carers, which further supports the idea that fun and engagement were a priority in the design."
