    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves a multi-disciplinary team of researchers and stakeholders with disabilities, indicating that both fun and utility were considered equally important in the design process. The use of wearable sensors to recognize body movements and adapt games for physical therapy also suggests a focus on utility beyond mere entertainment value. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves using a system called _Play_ _Access_ to enable children with haemophilia to play mobile games through personalizable interaction configurations that adapt to changes in user abilities. The system requires the user to manually label interface elements used to play on a screenshot of the game, and then specify the touchscreen interaction events to perform and the triggering actions required to activate them. This suggests that the design has a flexible structure with rules, as it allows for customization and adaptation based on the user's abilities and preferences. In contrast, unstructured play (option 1) would not involve any rules or structure, semi-structured play (option 2) would have some basic rules but allow for creativity within those rules, and flexible game (option 4) would have a set of rules that can be modified by the player. Rigid game (option 5) would have a fixed set of rules that cannot be changed by the player."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a telerehabilitation system that uses wearable sensors to track body movements during exercise. The system is designed to recognize different triggering actions, such as body movements, and use them to control a game or exercise. The preliminary results of an initial informal trial suggest that the choice of games, gestures, and their combinations is critical for the successful use of the system. This implies that the system is not entirely skill-based (option 1), as the success of the exercises depends on the combination of games and gestures used. Additionally, the study mentions that erroneous combinations of games and gestures can make the game too easy or too difficult, which suggests that there is an element of chance involved in the system (option 4). However, the system is not entirely chance-based (option 5), as the success of the exercises also depends on the user's skill level. Therefore, option (3) equally skill and chance-based best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves using a combination of games and gestures to create a telerehabilitation system for exercises. The choice of games and their combinations is critical for the successful use of the system, as it needs to be able to identify compatible interactions with the exercised body movements in terms of interaction speed and required reaction time. Additionally, the study involves assessing which games are commonly played, which replacement interfaces are most frequently used, and verifying whether different triggering actions are recognized correctly. These features suggest that the design is a mix of solo and social affordances, as it allows for both independent and collaborative play."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a system for telerehabilitation using wearable sensors to detect body movements and trigger games and gestures. The system allows users to play different games and use different replacement interfaces, and it is important to verify that the exercises are performed correctly without clinical supervision. While the study does not provide specific details on the game design, the description of the system suggests that turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time, which aligns with the (3) option."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the study is an equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances. The passage mentions that the system uses \"popular mobile games\" and \"replacement interfaces\" to create exergames, which suggests that the games are designed to be played at different times and in different locations. Additionally, the passage states that remote data collection can help clinicians verify if the exercises are performed correctly, which implies that there is some synchronous interaction between the clinicians and the patients. However, the passage also mentions that the usage of popular mobile games is meant to engage children and improve adherence to the training regimen, which suggests that there is a mix of asynchronous and synchronous affordances in the design. Therefore, option (3) is the best answer."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study discusses the importance of identifying games with compatible interactions with the exercised body movements, suggesting that a mix of competitive and collaborative games is critical for successful use in telerehabilitation. The authors mention that erroneous combinations of games and gestures can make the game too easy or unengaging, indicating that a mix of game types can provide a more challenging and engaging experience for users."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study design is a mix of both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements because the selected games have different gameplay mechanics and requirements. While some games, such as Pandemic, have a similar turn structure but different character abilities, making them both symmetrical and asymmetrical, others, such as Tag, are mostly asymmetrical. Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes is an entirely asymmetrical game, as the gameplay mechanics and requirements are drastically different from one another."
