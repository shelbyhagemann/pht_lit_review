    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves creating an AR experience on-the-fly or just-in-time during a therapy session, which suggests that both fun and utility are considered important from the outset. The use of the term \"design workshop with diverse stakeholders\" also implies that the focus is on creating an experience that is both enjoyable and useful for all participants, rather than just one group. Additionally, the mention of \"freezing AR experiences on the screen while keeping them interactive\" suggests that the goal is to create a balance between fun and utility."
  },
  {
    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv)",
    "reasoning": "The design of the application in the study was intended to be flexible and allow for creativity and improvisation among the children. The use of 3D models and the ability to add new objects to the AR experiences suggest a level of structured freedom, rather than a rigidly defined game with strict rules. Additionally, the design team's goal was to create an application that could be \"run with it\" by the children, without getting too bogged down in details. This flexibility allows for a more improvisational and creative approach to play, which is in line with the principles of improv."

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The study involved collecting data on the features of an AR application designed for children's learning activities. The application included various features such as 3D models, sharing AR experiences through an online portal, and written feedback. Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the application was equally skill and chance-based, as participants agreed that having more options or a broader range of 3D models would be helpful, but also noted that sharing AR experiences through an online portal is more complex and requires further thought. This suggests that both skill and chance played a role in the learning activities conducted on the application. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely solo (i.e., solitaire),\n    (2) mostly solo (i.e., playing against AI in single-player StarCraft),\n    (3) mix of solo and social affordances (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (4) mostly social, but aspects are independent (i.e., house on hill haunt transition),\n    (5) entirely social (i.e., tag)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the study, it can be inferred that the design is intended to offer a mix of solo and social affordances. The participants mentioned getting better at using the application over time, which suggests that there is some level of repetition or solo play involved. However, they also discussed adding 3D models to an AR experience for a math activity, which implies that there are opportunities for social interaction and collaboration. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study's description of the application's design suggests that it takes users through each step of the creation process sequentially, with buttons at the bottom of the screen allowing them to move between steps. This is consistent with the third option, which describes a design where turns are taken but some actions can be taken at any time. The study does not mention any other options, such as entirely turn-based or simultaneous play, and there is no indication that the application's design is entirely sequential or entirely simultaneous."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely synchronous (i.e., real time strategy game),\n    (2) mostly synchronous with a few asynchronous affordances (i.e., league of legends),\n    (3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances (i.e., helldivers 2),\n    (4) mostly asynchronous with few synchronous affordances (i.e. cookie clicker),\n    (5) entirely asynchronous (i.e., chess by postage mail)",
    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the application being studied is an equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances. This is because the participants mentioned getting better at using the application over time, which suggests that there is some level of repetition or consistency in their use of the application. Additionally, the passage mentions preparing resources or creating exercise material according to each child's interests, which implies that the application has a degree of flexibility and customization. However, the passage also states that sharing AR experiences through an online portal is more complex and requires further thought, which suggests that there are some aspects of the application that are not entirely synchronous or asynchronous. Therefore, option (3) is the best answer."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely competitive (i.e., spit card game),\n    (2) mostly competitive, but sometimes collaboration is important (i.e., forbidden island),\n    (3) mix of competitive and collaborative (i.e., mario party 2 vs 2 mini-games),\n    (4) mostly collaborative (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (5) entirely collaborative (i.e., pandemic)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The design of the application in the study involved a mix of competitive and collaborative elements. While the game idea was simple enough for students to \"run with it\" and come up with their own creative uses, participants agreed that having more options or a broader range of 3D models would be helpful. This suggests that the design was not entirely competitive or entirely collaborative, but rather a mix of both. Additionally, the use of multiple 3D models in an AR experience for a math activity (e.g., 2 + 5) supports this conclusion."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study's design involves creating an application that enhances symbolic knowledge for minimally verbal children with autism. The application is designed to be simple enough for SLPs to use in therapy, but also allows for customization and creativity. This suggests that the design is not entirely symmetrical (as there needs to be room for variation and creativity), but also not entirely asymmetrical (as there needs to be some structure and consistency). Therefore, the best answer is (3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical."

    "question": "How would you classify the experiential play value? Do not add additional context or reasoning in your response: \n    sensority (i.e. kaleidoscope, experiencing art), \n    fantasy (i.e. role-playing), \n    construction (i.e. music, painting, building), \n    challenge (testing physical or mental abilities against others or self), \n    undisclosed/unknown, but the paper does include a game/play system or experience, \n    not applicable",
    "answer": "Construction.",
    "reasoning": "The paper describes the application as allowing participants to create and customize picture-based AR experiences from scratch using their own images and virtual content. This suggests that the application is focused on creativity and construction, rather than other types of experiential play values such as fantasy or sensority. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a game/play system or experience, which further supports the classification of the experiential play value as construction."

Please select all that apply:\n    workshop or design session, \n    field study, \n    usability testing, \n    case study, \n    focus group,\n    controlled experiment, \n    survey, \n    telemetry/big data/cscw, \n    secondary analysis, \n    no data collected,\n    other (please specify)",
    "answer": "The study method that applies to this paper is usability testing.",
    "reasoning": "The paper describes conducting formal user studies with therapists and educational professionals at the end of phase II, which suggests that the authors collected data through direct observation and interaction with participants in a controlled environment. This is consistent with the definition of usability testing, which involves evaluating the usability of a product or system through direct observation and interaction with users in a controlled setting. Additionally, the paper mentions thematic analysis of written feedback, transcripts of voice notes, and interview recordings, which is a common method used in usability testing to identify patterns and themes in user behavior and feedback."

    "answer": "Semi-structured interview.",
    "reasoning": "The passage describes the data collection methods used in a user study, including a short Qualtrics survey for written feedback and one-on-one interviews via Zoom at the end of a 2-week diary study. These interviews were described as \"semi-structured,\" meaning they had a predetermined structure but allowed for some flexibility in the questions asked based on the participants' responses. This is supported by the passage's mention of sending reminders and encouragement to participants during the diary study and conducting interviews via Zoom at the end of the period, which suggests a degree of structure and planning went into the interview process."
