    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study design in the passage prioritizes both fun and utility from the start. The system is designed to be personalizable and adaptable to changes in user abilities, indicating that it was intended to be enjoyable for users while also providing therapeutic benefits. The use of wearable sensors to recognize body movements and input them into gameplay suggests a focus on utility as well. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves using a system called _Play_ _Access_ to enable children with haemophilia to play mobile games through personalizable interaction configurations, adapting to changes in user abilities. The system requires the user to manually label interface elements used to play on a screenshot of the game and specify touchscreen interaction events and triggering actions required to activate them. This design involves a flexible structure with rules, as it allows the user to customize the gameplay experience based on their abilities and preferences, while still maintaining some structure and control over the gameplay. Options (1) unstructured play, (2) semi-structured play, and (4) flexible game are not as well suited to this design, as they do not provide the same level of customization and control. Option (5) game with rigid rules is also not a good fit, as it would not allow for the adaptability and personalization needed in this context."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "The study mentions that the system is designed to recognize body movements confidently and verify whether different recorded inputs are recognized correctly. This suggests that the system is not entirely skill-based, as it requires the user to perform specific actions with their body. However, it also acknowledges that chance can play a role in the outcome of the game, as the system needs to recognize different recorded inputs. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a telerehabilitation system that incorporates various games, gestures, and sensor data to support physical rehabilitation exercises. While the system allows for autonomous usage without clinical supervision, it also provides social affordances through the use of wearable sensors and sensor data. The design does not appear to be entirely solo (option 1) or mostly solo with AI opponents (option 2), as the focus is on combining games and gestures for a mix of solo and social affordances (option 3). Additionally, the study mentions verifying whether different triggering actions are recognized correctly, which suggests that the system has some level of autonomy and social interaction (option 4). However, the design does not seem to be entirely social (option 5), as the study emphasizes the importance of identifying games with compatible interactions and sensor data for successful use in telerehabilitation."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a telerehabilitation system that uses wearable sensors to detect body movements and trigger games and gestures. The system is designed to be flexible and adaptive, allowing users to choose from a variety of games and gestures based on their exercise needs and preferences. However, the system also includes a turn-based mechanism where users take turns performing exercises and interacting with the system. This suggests that the design is a hybrid of (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time, and (1) entirely turn-based systems, as it combines the flexibility of the latter with the structure of the former."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a system for telerehabilitation, which involves using wearable sensors to track body movements and translate them into gameplay inputs. The authors mention that it is important to identify games having compatible interactions with the exercised body movements, in terms of interaction speed and required reaction time. This suggests that the system is designed to allow for both synchronous and asynchronous interactions, as it needs to be able to recognize body movements in real-time but also allow for some flexibility in terms of when the movements are performed. Additionally, the authors mention that remote data collection can help clinicians support patients remotely, which further supports the idea that the system is designed to have a mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study involves using a combination of games and gestures to create an interactive system for telerehabilitation. The authors mention that it is important to identify games with compatible interactions with the exercised body movements, indicating that the system should be able to accommodate both competitive and collaborative elements. The use of multiple games and gestures allows for a variety of exercises and activities, which can be tailored to the individual's needs and abilities. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "Structured interview and Semi-structured interview.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the interviewer used a structured interview methodology to gather information from the patients. A structured interview involves asking standardized questions in a predetermined order, which helps ensure consistency and accuracy in the data collection process. Additionally, the interviewer may have also employed semi-structured interview methodology, which allows for some flexibility in the questioning while still maintaining a structured framework.
