    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first",
    "reasoning": "The study design in the passage prioritizes both fun and utility from the start. The system was designed with personalizable interaction configurations to adapt to changes in user abilities, indicating that both fun and utility were considered important from the outset. Additionally, the use of wearable sensors to recognize body movements and input them into games suggests a focus on utility as well as fun. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a system called _Play_ _Access_ that allows children with physical impairments to play mobile games using personalizable interaction configurations and wearable sensors to recognize body movements as input for playing games. The system requires the user to manually label interface elements used to play on a screenshot of the game, specify touchscreen interaction events, and define triggering actions required to activate them. This suggests that the design has a flexible structure with rules in place, allowing users to personalize their experience and interact with the system in a variety of ways."

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "(2) Mostly skill-based",
    "reasoning": "The study focuses on assessing the effectiveness of a telerehabilitation system for upper limb rehabilitation, and mentions using wearable sensors to track body movements. This suggests that the games played are not purely based on chance, but also require some level of skill and control, such as tapping a screen at a specific position or extending a leg in a particular way. While there may be some element of chance involved in the games, the primary focus is on using the system to improve motor skills through repetition and practice, which is why (2) Mostly skill-based is the best answer."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study is designed to provide a mix of solo and social affordances for the participants. While the system uses AI to adapt the difficulty level of the exercises based on the participant's performance, it also allows for social interaction through the use of wearable sensors that track the participant's movements and display them on a screen for both the participant and the clinical supervisor to observe. This allows for a more engaging and motivating experience for the participants, as they can see their progress and be held accountable by the clinical supervisor. Additionally, the use of wearable sensors provides an opportunity for the participants to practice the exercises independently, without the need for constant supervision."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves the use of wearable sensors to detect body movements and trigger games and gestures. The participants are given a choice of games to play, and the system is able to recognize different triggering actions. This suggests that the turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time, which is consistent with the design of pandemic-style games."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely synchronous (i.e., real time strategy game),\n    (2) mostly synchronous with a few asynchronous affordances (i.e., league of legends),\n    (3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances (i.e., helldivers 2),\n    (4) mostly asynchronous with few synchronous affordances (i.e. cookie clicker),\n    (5) entirely asynchronous (i.e., chess by postage mail)",
    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a system that incorporates various games, gestures, and sensor data to support telerehabilitation. While the system is designed to be responsive to user input in real-time, it also allows for some degree of asynchronous interaction. This is evident from the mention of remote data collection and the use of popular mobile games to engage children and improve adherence to the training regimen. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely competitive (i.e., spit card game),\n    (2) mostly competitive, but sometimes collaboration is important (i.e., forbidden island),\n    (3) mix of competitive and collaborative (i.e., mario party 2 vs 2 mini-games),\n    (4) mostly collaborative (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (5) entirely collaborative (i.e., pandemic)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study mentions the importance of identifying games with compatible interactions with the exercised body movements, and the need to verify that the exercises are performed correctly during autonomous usage without a clinical supervisor. This suggests that the design is not entirely competitive or entirely collaborative, but rather a mix of both. The study also mentions using different games for different exercises, which further supports the idea of a mix of competitive and collaborative elements in the design."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study design described in the passage is a mixed design that combines both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements. On one hand, the games selected for the study are all designed to have a similar turn structure, which suggests a certain degree of symmetry. However, each game also has unique character abilities or behaviors that introduce asymmetry into the gameplay. For example, in Pandemic, different characters have different abilities and roles, while in Tag, players take turns playing as different characters with distinct abilities. Therefore, the design can be classified as both symmetrical and asymmetrical."
