    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first",
    "reasoning": "The study design in the passage prioritizes both fun and utility from the beginning of the development process. The authors mention that the system was designed through a \"design workshop with diverse stakeholders,\" indicating that multiple perspectives were involved in the creation of the system. Additionally, the authors emphasize the importance of age-appropriateness, engagement, and variety in the exercises to keep patients motivated and interested. These factors suggest that the design prioritized both fun and utility from the outset."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves using a system called _Play_ _Access_ to allow children with haemophilia to play mobile games through personalizable interaction configurations, adapting to changes in user abilities. This suggests that the design has a flexible structure with rules, as it allows for customization and adaptation to individual user needs. Unstructured play (option 1) would not typically involve any rules or structure, while semi-structured play (option 2) may have some rules but still allow for creativity and improvisation. Improv (option 3) is a type of performance art that involves creating scenes, stories, or characters through spontaneous movement and sound, so it is similar to the flexible structure with rules in the study design. Board games with house rules (option 4) typically have a fixed set of rules, while video games (option 5) often have strict rules and objectives that must be followed."

    "answer": "(2) mostly skill-based",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a telerehabilitation system that uses wearable sensors to track the user's body movements and trigger actions in a game. The games mentioned in the passage are Super Mario Run, Mario Kart, Catan, Uno, and dice games. While some of these games may involve chance elements, such as rolling dice or drawing cards, they are primarily skill-based and require the player to perform specific actions or moves to progress. For example, in Super Mario Run, the player must tap on the screen at a given position to make Mario jump, while in Mario Kart, the player must use specific buttons to control their character's movements. Similarly, in Catan, players must make strategic decisions to progress and Uno is a card game that requires players to play cards of a specific color or action to progress. Therefore, the design of the telerehabilitation system is focused on skill-based games, rather than chance-based games."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves using a combination of solo and social games to provide exercises for participants. The games are designed to be played both autonomously and with a clinical supervisor, allowing for a mix of solo and social affordances. This approach allows for flexibility in the design, as different games can be used depending on the participant's needs and preferences."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a telerehabilitation system that uses wearable sensors to detect body movements and trigger games and gestures. The system is designed to be flexible and adaptive, allowing users to choose from different games and gestures based on their preferences and goals. However, the system also includes a turn-based mechanism where users take turns performing actions, such as exercises or gameplay. This suggests that the design is a mix of (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time, and (1) entirely turn-based systems, as users take turns performing actions in a specific order, but can also perform certain actions at any time during their turn."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the system is not entirely synchronous, as there are games that require real-time interactions, such as Figure 3, which shows wearable sensors and sensor data. However, the passage also mentions that there are games that allow for asynchronous interactions, such as Helldivers 2. This suggests that the design of the system is an equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances, allowing users to interact with the system in different ways depending on their preferences and needs."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative",
    "reasoning": "The study involves using a combination of games and gestures to create an interactive system for telerehabilitation. The choice of games and their combinations is critical for successful use, as it needs to be compatible with the exercised body movements in terms of interaction speed and required reaction time. This suggests that the design is not entirely competitive (1) or entirely collaborative (5), but rather a mix of competitive and collaborative elements (3)."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study mentions that the design of the system is critical for its successful use in telerehabilitation, and that it is important to identify games with compatible interactions with the exercised body movements. This suggests that the design should be able to accommodate both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements. Additionally, the study mentions that the exercises are performed correctly during autonomous usage without a clinical supervisor, which implies that the design should be able to handle a variety of player actions and inputs. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "How would you classify the experiential play value? Do not add additional context or reasoning in your response: \n    sensority (i.e. kaleidoscope, experiencing art), \n    fantasy (i.e. role-playing), \n    construction (i.e. music, painting, building), \n    challenge (testing physical or mental abilities against others or self), \n    undisclosed/unknown, but the paper does include a game/play system or experience, \n    not applicable",
    "answer": "The experiential play value of the proposed system can be classified as fantasy.",
    "reasoning": "The system involves using popular mobile games as exergames, which are games that provide physical and mental stimulation to players. The use of wearable sensors to recognize body movements and adapt gameplay based on user abilities suggests a focus on fantasy play, as it allows users to immerse themselves in a virtual world and experience different scenarios and challenges. While the system does include a game/play component, its primary purpose is not to provide a challenge against others or self, but rather to support physical therapy in children with haemophilia through immersive and engaging gameplay. Therefore, the experiential play value can be classified as fantasy."
