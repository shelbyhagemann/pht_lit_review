    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage focused on designing a system for children with disabilities, and involved interactive design sessions with disabled stakeholders. The authors used Thematic Analysis to extract design recommendations from the transcripts of these sessions. These recommendations emphasized the importance of both fun and utility in the design of the system, suggesting that both factors were given equal consideration during the design process. Therefore, option (3) Both fun and utility first best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves children participating in a series of programming activities using TIP-Toy, a tangible programming system. While the activities are structured to some extent, the system allows for flexibility in terms of the rules and mechanisms that underlie its operation. Children are able to explore and learn about computational concepts through play, and the study's findings suggest that this approach is effective in helping children understand the particular rules underlying the system's operation. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The design of the TIP-Toy evaluation study is equally skill and chance-based, as it involves a mix of tasks that require both technical skills (such as coding and debugging) and luck or chance (such as experimenting and iterating). While some tasks may favor those with more technical expertise, others may be more dependent on luck or chance. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a programming environment for children, which includes physical blocks that can be manipulated to create programs. The authors mention that the system is designed to support both solo and social interactions, with the goal of enabling novices, parents, and teachers to contribute to further developments. They also acknowledge that increasing the complexity of the system is possible to some extent, but that there are limitations due to the physical characteristics of TUIs (text-based user interfaces) that cannot be overcome."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the system in the passage, it is clear that the design is a mix of turn-based and real-time elements. The participants were asked to press buttons to play sequences and trigger events, but there was no explicit mention of a set order for taking turns. Instead, the passage states that \"pressing one button would play the sequence, whereas pressing the other button would trigger the Read aloud.\" This suggests that players can take actions at any time, but there may be limitations or restrictions on when certain actions can be taken. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study used a combination of block-based programming and tangible programming elements, which allows for both synchronous and asynchronous interactions. The children were given the option to use variable blocks that could be placed inside the command block, which suggests a mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances. Additionally, the study aimed to provide an inclusive design that could accommodate different learning styles and abilities, which further supports the idea of an equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves children working together to design and build a system for programming, using a combination of individual blocks and collaboration to create a final product. While there are some aspects of competition involved in the process (such as the need to complete tasks within a certain time frame), the overall focus of the study is on collaboration and problem-solving through joint effort. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes TIP-Toy as a computational toolkit that aims to support children with mixed visual abilities to explore computing concepts and practices while playing independently. The design of the system is not entirely symmetrical, as it includes blocks with different shapes and colors that can be combined in various ways to create complex structures. However, it also includes some elements that are mostly symmetrical, such as the use of variable blocks that can modify the execution of play, pause, or repeat functions. This combination of both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements allows for a more inclusive design that can accommodate children with different visual abilities."

    "question": "How would you classify the experiential play value? Do not add additional context or reasoning in your response: \n    sensority (i.e. kaleidoscope, experiencing art), \n    fantasy (i.e. role-playing), \n    construction (i.e. music, painting, building), \n    challenge (testing physical or mental abilities against others or self), \n    undisclosed/unknown, but the paper does include a game/play system or experience, \n    not applicable",
    "answer": "Construction",
    "reasoning": "The TIP-Toy evaluation mentions that the program is designed to enable children to complete specific activities and transition between different tasks appropriate to their age and computing abilities. The use of microcontrollers and musical outputs suggests a focus on construction and making, as well as collaboration and problem-solving. While the paper does not explicitly mention any experiential play value, the design of TIP-Toy and the inclusion of music and storytelling elements suggest a construction-oriented approach to play."
