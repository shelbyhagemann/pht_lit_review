    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first",
    "reasoning": "Based on the findings of the study, it can be inferred that the design approach was focused on providing both fun and utility for BPSP individuals. The researchers used a design workshop with diverse stakeholders, including BPSP participants, to co-create shared sensory experiences. This approach allowed for a more inclusive and participatory design process, where BPSP individuals had an active role in planning, executing, and reminiscing about leisure experiences. The interdependence of these interactions was seen as having a positive impact on the overall experience, rather than prioritizing one aspect over the other. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "The study by Hammitt [31] focuses on the outdoor recreation experience and identifies it as a multi-phase experience. The authors argue that the traditional model of leisure experience proposed by C&K [19] is limited in its ability to capture the complexity of leisure experiences. They propose a new framework that considers the perspective of BPSP (Breadth, Depth, Participation, and Satisfaction) to overcome these limitations."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The study design can be categorized as equally skill and chance-based because it involves the use of technologies for engaging with nature, which requires a combination of skills and luck. The participants were asked to collaboratively explore and engage with the experience, which suggests that there is an element of chance involved in the activity. Additionally, the study used a deductive thematic analysis approach, which involves applying codes based on existing theories or models, such as the C&K model. This suggests that the design was influenced by pre-existing frameworks and concepts, rather than being entirely skill-based or chance-based."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design as having both solo and social affordances, allowing players to engage in different activities depending on their preferences. For example, while some players may enjoy exploring the environment alone, others may prefer to interact with other players. The design allows for a mix of both solo and social experiences, which is consistent with the definition provided in the question."

    "answer": "(3) Turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the recreational activity as involving a \"phase 1 - Planning\" stage, where the recreationist(s) plan the cost of the trip, equipment and supplies needed for a successful recreational experience. This suggests that there is some level of planning and preparation involved in the activity, which does not fit with entirely turn-based (option 1) or set steps (option 2) designs. Additionally, the study mentions that participants adapted their long cane techniques to navigate irregular terrain while hiking, which implies that actions can be taken at any time during the experience (option 3). Finally, the study does not mention any phases with fixed turns or a turn-based structure (options 4 and 5), further supporting option 3 as the best fit for the design."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves planning, executing, and reminiscing about leisure experiences, which suggests a mix of both synchronous and asynchronous activities. While the on-site activity phase is described as including a range of activities that vary depending on the affordance of the space and the recreational preferences of individuals, the planning phase involves deciding the time, location, and duration of the recreational activity, which suggests some level of synchronous planning. Additionally, the study refers to technology having the potential to enhance the experience of visitors by enabling interaction, exploration, and engagement with nature, which implies that there are asynchronous affordances available as well. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study involved designing a leisure experience for blind and partially sighted individuals, which suggests that the focus is on collaboration rather than competition. While there may be some competitive elements to the experience, such as in the \"Mario Party 2 vs 2\" mini-games, the overall design appears to prioritize cooperation and shared fun among participants."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of the tactile maps used in the research as \"irregular terrain\" and \"uneven paths and surfaces,\" indicating that the terrain is not entirely symmetrical. Additionally, the participants adapted their long cane techniques to navigate the irregular terrain while hiking, which suggests that the terrain was not completely symmetrical. However, the study also mentions that the multisensory experience of being in natural environments and engaging in a shared experience with companions is appreciated, which indicates that there is some level of symmetry in the design. Therefore, the best answer is (3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical."

    "answer": "Construction",

    "reasoning": "Based on the passage, it is clear that the researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 BPSP (11 male, 9 female) to further investigate how BPSP experience outdoor nature. The interviews were conducted between 30 and 80 minutes and were not structured in a rigid format. This indicates that the interview methodology used was semi-structured, which allows for some flexibility and spontaneity during the interview process."

    "answer": "Autoethnography and Diary Study.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the context provided, we can infer that the researchers used autoethnography and diary study methodologies to collect data from participants. The passage mentions that the researchers \"conducted interviews and focus groups\" and also \"collected data through life-logging,\" which suggests that they employed both autoethnography and diary study methods. Autoethnography is a qualitative research methodology that involves reflecting on one's own experiences and cultural background, while diary studies involve collecting data through daily journal entries or other regular writing exercises. Therefore, both of these methodologies were likely used in the study."

    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it is clear that the focus of the study was on individuals who are blind or have low vision. The passage states that \"all participants were active users of smartphones and other digital technology,\" which suggests that they are familiar with technology and able to use it effectively.
