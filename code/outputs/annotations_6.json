    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the virtual environment in the study was intended to be both fun and useful for the participants. The passage mentions that the platform allows users to \"enrich\" the environment, which suggests that it is designed to be interactive and engaging. Additionally, the fact that participants were asked to create and navigate a virtual supermarket suggests that the design has a practical utility beyond just being entertaining. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the platform allowed participants to create and navigate a virtual environment with some structure but also allowed for flexibility and creativity. The use of the term \"elicitation session\" suggests that the platform was designed to encourage participants to add their own elements to the environment, rather than following a strict set of rules or guidelines. Additionally, the passage highlights the ability to add interactivity and tasks to the environment, which further supports the idea that the design was flexible and allowed for creativity and improvisation."

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The design of the study involved creating a virtual environment that could be navigated and used to perform tasks, with the goal of training different cognitive functions. While participants had some experience with VR creation, the platform was not exclusively skill-based, as it required both skill and chance to navigate and complete tasks. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study design included sharing mechanisms, allowing users to make their environments publicly available and notifying them when they are used by others. This suggests that the platform offers both solo and social affordances, as users can create and interact with the environment on their own or with others. Additionally, the ability to enrich the environment with interactivity and tasks points towards a mix of solo and social affordances, as users can add elements to the environment that can be completed independently or with others."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a virtual environment for reminiscence therapy, which involves creating a virtual representation of a patient's past experiences. The design allows patients to navigate through the virtual environment and interact with objects and events from their past, such as revisiting familiar places or reliving memorable moments. While the study does not specify the exact mechanics of how turns are taken, it mentions that some actions can be taken at any time, indicating a mix of turn-based and real-time elements."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely synchronous (i.e., real time strategy game),\n    (2) mostly synchronous with a few asynchronous affordances (i.e., league of legends),\n    (3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances (i.e., helldivers 2),\n    (4) mostly asynchronous with few synchronous affordances (i.e. cookie clicker),\n    (5) entirely asynchronous (i.e., chess by postage mail)",
    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the study involved a mix of synchronous and asynchronous elements. The authors mention that users could create and navigate their own environments, which suggests a degree of agency and control over the virtual space. However, they also note that the platform included sharing mechanisms, which implies that other users could access and interact with the environments as well. This blend of synchronous and asynchronous elements is consistent with a design that seeks to balance the benefits of both approaches."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely competitive (i.e., spit card game),\n    (2) mostly competitive, but sometimes collaboration is important (i.e., forbidden island),\n    (3) mix of competitive and collaborative (i.e., mario party 2 vs 2 mini-games),\n    (4) mostly collaborative (i.e., animal crossing),\n    (5) entirely collaborative (i.e., pandemic)",
    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the platform in the passage, it seems that the design is a mix of competitive and collaborative elements. The ability to add interactivity and tasks to the environment, as well as the inclusion of sharing mechanisms, suggests that there is a degree of competition involved in using the platform. However, the fact that users can create and enrich their own environments also implies a level of collaboration, as they are working together to create a shared space. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves creating tasks and goals in a navigation session, which suggests that the environment is not entirely symmetrical. However, the use of blue circles to indicate paths and goals suggests some degree of symmetry. Therefore, the best answer is (3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical."
