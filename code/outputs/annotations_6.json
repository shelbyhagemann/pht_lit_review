    "answer": "(3) both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study used the Design Box method, which is a participatory design approach that involves stakeholders from various disciplines and backgrounds. This approach prioritizes both fun and utility in the design process, as it seeks to create solutions that are both enjoyable and effective. The study also involved individuals with spinal cord injuries and tetraplegia participating in adaptive recreation camps, which further highlights the importance of considering both fun and utility in the design."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "The study used the Design Box method, which involves facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration and participatory design in a structured yet flexible manner. The method includes a series of inductive ideation sessions with different stakeholders, including the research team, development team, medical provider stakeholders, individuals with SCI/D, and individuals with tetraplegia participating in adaptive recreation camps. The study also involved gathering additional design input from individuals with SCI/D and individuals with tetraplegia through various means."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves using a simulation to evaluate the capabilities of participants with tetraplegia in using the Tetra-Ski. While the simulation may involve some level of skill, such as controlling the speed and direction of the Tetra-Ski, there is also an element of chance involved, such as the terrain on which the participant must navigate. This is evident from the data presented in Table 5, which shows that both SipNPuff users (P1 and P4) started with lower performance scores and spent more time using the simulation than Joystick users (P5 and P7). Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering the unique presentations of individuals with tetraplegia when designing the Tetra-Ski experience. This suggests that the design is not solely based on skill, but also takes into account the role of chance in determining the participant's abilities."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study used the Design Box method, which involves a combination of individual and group brainstorming sessions to generate design ideas. The participants included individuals with spinal cord injuries or tetraplegia, medical providers, and members of the development team. The design goals mentioned in the passage include \"independent piloting\" and \"shared control,\" which suggest that the design was intended to accommodate a range of physical abilities and prior skiing experience. While the passage does not explicitly state that the design is a mix of solo and social affordances, it does mention that the design input gathered included input from individuals with SCI/D and individuals with tetraplegia participating in adaptive recreation camps, as well as patients at hospital locations. This suggests that the design was intended to be accessible to a diverse range of users, including those who may not be able to use the simulation independently. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of Tetra-Ski, a skiing simulation game that allows players to control their skis using a combination of intuitive movements and binary commands. While the game has a turn-based structure, with each player taking turns performing actions, some actions can be taken at any time during the turn, such as adjusting the wedge of the skis or turning right/left multiple times. This makes the gameplay more dynamic and responsive to player input, rather than purely turn-based. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "reasoning": "The study used the Design Box method, which involves a series of discrete inductive ideation sessions with different stakeholders, including the research team, development team, medical provider stakeholders, individuals with SCI/D, and individuals with tetraplegia participating in adaptive recreation camps. This suggests that the design process involved a mix of competitive and collaborative elements, as different groups were involved in the ideation sessions. Additionally, the study mentioned that participants did not comment directly on the control scheme when asked about it, which suggests that there was a mix of control mechanisms in place."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study used a design that was both symmetrical and asymmetrical. On one hand, the simulation trials involved a standardized and repetitive task (Tetra-Ski) that required participants to perform a specific action in a consistent manner. This aspect of the design can be considered symmetrical as it involves a predictable and repeatable sequence of actions."
