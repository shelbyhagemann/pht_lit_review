    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study in question involves the co-design of a tangible device that provides entertainment and opportunities for social engagement for one non-verbal adult participant with intellectual disability. The authors emphasize the importance of designing for one, rather than attempting to create universal designs that can be used by most people. They argue that this approach is more effective in meeting the distinct needs of individuals with profound disabilities."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves co-design sessions with a participant who has an intellectual disability, during which they create and test sensory musical blankets. The design process is iterative and includes observing the participant's interactions with prototypes and commercially available toys to determine their preferences and needs. This suggests that the design process involves a flexible structure with rules, as it is tailored to the participant's individual needs and preferences, rather than following a rigid set of rules or guidelines."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The study mentioned in the passage is focused on designing technology for one participant, which suggests that the design is not intended to be universally applicable but rather tailored to the individual's needs. While the study does mention that assistive technology can ensure engagement, it also highlights the importance of considering the participant's distinct needs. This implies that the design is not purely skill-based or chance-based, but rather a combination of both."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study involves co-designing a tangible technology with one participant, which suggests that the design is not entirely solo or mostly social. Rather, it has a mix of solo and social affordances, as the participant is involved in the design process but also interacts with peers during the development of the sensory musical blanket. This mix of solo and social affordances allows for both individual creativity and collaboration among participants, which is a key contribution of the research."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the passage, it is clear that the design of the study involved a support worker helping the participant remove their shoes and stroke tactile buttons with their feet. This suggests that the design was not entirely turn-based, as there were specific actions that could be taken at any time (such as stroking tactile buttons). Additionally, the passage mentions that the blanket was designed to be \"deliberately playful\" and provide \"expressive representation through music,\" which further suggests that the game was not purely turn-based."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves participants playing a game together in real-time, but also includes elements that can be played asynchronously. The authors mention that \"participants began to realize quickly that the person who pressed the button first would get their favorite song snippet played in its entirety,\" which suggests that there is some degree of synchrony in the game. However, they also note that \"games were silently and organically created by the participants,\" which implies that there are also opportunities for asynchronous play. Therefore, option (3) is the best fit for the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design process as involving co-design sessions with one participant, who created a sensory musical blanket with their peers. The participants were shown to be competitive in pressing their buttons to play their favorite song snippet, but they also collaborated in creating games and competing to see who could press their button first. This mix of competitive and collaborative elements is consistent with the design being (3) a mix of competitive and collaborative."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The design of the ExpressiBall, as described in the study, involves co-designing with minimally verbal children on the autism spectrum to create a musical blanket that can be used for self-expression. The blanket is designed to be deliberately playful and provide expressive representation through music, with ambiguity built into its design to foster flexible interactions and generate new interaction scenarios. This suggests that while there may be some symmetry in the design of the blanket (e.g., in the placement of musical notes or the use of certain colors), there are also elements that are asymmetrical and unique to each individual's experience. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "Construction.",
    "reasoning": "The study involved designing and co-designing a tangible device to provide entertainment and opportunities for social engagement to a non-verbal adult participant with intellectual disability. This suggests that the focus was on creating something that could be physically manipulated or constructed, rather than purely sensory or imaginative experiences. The use of a game/play system or experience also supports this classification."

    "reasoning": "Based on the text, it is clear that the researchers involved in the co-design process with John used a combination of these methodologies to understand his needs and preferences. The text mentions that the design process was \"exploratory in nature\" and involved creating simple prototypes and presenting them to John to determine his preferences and needs [1]. This suggests that think aloud and cognitive walkthrough methods were used to observe John's interactions with the prototypes and gather insights into his thought processes. Additionally, the text mentions that the researchers learned John's unique mannerisms through close co-design work with him, which suggests that expert analysis was also used to understand John's individual needs and preferences [2]."

    "answer": "The context of the study was a research lab and a disability community space (i.e. Day program).",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it is clear that the study took place in a research lab and a disability community space (i.e. Day program). The passage mentions that the participant was selected for the study due to his minimal participation in group activities and the limited availability of engaging activities outside of using his iPad. This suggests that the study took place in a controlled environment, such as a research lab, where the participant could be observed and studied. Additionally, the passage mentions that the participant was unable to read, which may have made it difficult for him to participate in group exercises or activities taking place outside of the research lab. Therefore, it is unlikely that the study took place in a public space such as a bowling alley or a social media platform."

    "reasoning": "Based on the given text, it appears that participant recruitment methods used in the study included convenience sampling (i.e. Day program), snowball, and word of mouth. The authors mention that John was selected for the study due to his minimal participation in group activities and the limited availability of engaging activities outside of using his iPad, which suggests that they may have used convenience sampling to identify participants who were easily accessible and willing to participate. Additionally, the authors mention that John's peers played a role in recruiting other participants, which could be an example of snowball recruitment. Word of mouth is also possible, as the authors note that the study was conducted in a day program setting where participants were already known to each other.
