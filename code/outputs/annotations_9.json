    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design process involved both fun and utility elements from the start. The study involved small groups of students who were allowed to work together while still feeling included, and they became personally invested in the design process. The students were given opportunities to contribute their ideas and interact with prototypes, which suggests that both fun and utility aspects were considered during the design process. Additionally, the passage states that the UMBC students presented how the designs had evolved that day, indicating that the design process was ongoing and involved both fun and utility elements from the beginning."

  {
    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules)",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the study, it seems that the design involved creating a game with flexible rules that could be tailored to the needs and abilities of each player. The use of small, self-chosen teams and the presentation of designs evolved during the activity suggest a more collaborative and adaptive approach to game design.

    "question": "\"Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely skill-based (i.e., trivia, sports),\n    (2) mostly skill-based (i.e., mario kart),\n    (3) equally skill and chance-based (i.e., catan),\n    (4) mostly chance-based (i.e., Uno),\n    (5) entirely chance-based (i.e., all dice)",
    "answer": "(3) Equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "The study involved students interacting with app and game prototypes in small, self-chosen teams. This suggests that the design activities were not purely skill-based, as students were able to contribute their ideas and work together to develop the designs. Additionally, the use of both working and paper prototypes allowed for a mix of skill and chance-based elements. While some students may have preferred working with the more complex, high-fidelity prototypes, others may have found it easier to work with the simpler, low-fidelity paper prototypes. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely turn-based (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) follows a set of steps (i.e., viticulture's dynamic turn ordering),\n    (3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time (i.e., pandemic),\n    (4) most actions can be taken at any time, but there are some phases (i.e., PvP death reset timer),\n    (5) entirely simultaneous (i.e., race)",
    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design process as involving small groups of students working together to develop their own game or app prototypes. The students were allowed to take turns contributing their ideas and designs, but some actions could be taken at any time within the small groups. This suggests that the design was not entirely turn-based (option 1), nor did it follow a set of steps (option 2) like viticulture's dynamic turn ordering. Instead, the students had some flexibility in when they could take actions during the design process, making it more similar to pandemic (option 3)."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the design workshop, it can be inferred that the activity was designed to allow for both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration among the students. The use of small, self-chosen teams and the presentation of designs after two PD sessions suggest a mix of real-time and asynchronous elements. Additionally, the fact that the students became \"personally invested in the design process\" and retained positive feelings after the workshop suggests that the activity was designed to allow for both individual and group contributions. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, the design of the activity was a mix of competitive and collaborative elements. The students were divided into small groups to work on their designs, which suggests a collaborative approach. However, the passage also mentions that the students were \"personally invested in the design process\" and \"were more willing to contribute their ideas during small group sessions compared to the large group session,\" which implies that there was some level of competition among the groups. Additionally, the use of both working prototypes and paper prototypes suggests that there was a mix of hands-on activities that required collaboration and competition. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely symmetrical (i.e., tic tac toe),\n    (2) mostly symmetrical (i.e., undertale's differing NPC behaviors based on previous playthroughs),\n    (3) both symmetrical and asymmetrical (i.e., pandemic with its similar turn structure but different character abilities),\n    (4) mostly asymmetrical (i.e., tag),\n    (5) entirely asymmetrical (i.e., keep talking, nobody explodes)",
    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the description of the design activities in the study, it can be seen that the design was a mix of both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements. On one hand, the students were encouraged to contribute their ideas during small group sessions, which suggests a level of symmetry in the design process. On the other hand, the use of working and paper prototypes allowed for a more inclusive and diverse design process, where each student could have a hands-on experience and bring their unique perspective to the table. This blend of both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements can be observed in games like Pandemic, which have a similar turn structure but different character abilities, creating a more dynamic and varied gameplay experience."
