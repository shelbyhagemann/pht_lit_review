    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first",
    "reasoning": "The design of the study is focused on creating an AR experience that is both fun and useful for children with autism. The researchers involve children in the design process and allow them to freeze AR experiences on the screen while keeping the experiences interactive, indicating that the primary goal is to create a fun and engaging experience while also incorporating utility. The use of the term \"design workshop\" and the involvement of diverse stakeholders further suggest that the focus is on creating a collaborative and inclusive design process."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv)",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it is clear that the design of the application was intended to be flexible and allow for creativity and improvisation among the users. The use of the term \"improv\" in the passage suggests that the design team wanted to create a structure that would allow children to freely express themselves and come up with new ideas without being too restricted by rules or limitations. Additionally, the mention of participants agreeing that having \"more options\" (P1) or a \"broader range\" (P2) of 3D models would be helpful further supports the idea that the design was intended to be flexible and allow for a wide range of possibilities."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the application in the study was equally skill and chance-based. This is because participants were able to provide written feedback on how they used the application and what features they found helpful, but there was also a mention of getting better at using the application over time with repeated use. This suggests that while some skills may be required to use the application effectively, there is also an element of chance or randomness involved in its use. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study described a design that included both solo and social aspects, allowing users to play either independently or with others. Participants were able to create their own 3D models and use them in AR experiences, which suggests a mix of solo and social affordances. While some features, such as the ability to add multiple 3D models to an AR experience, were mentioned as being helpful, there is no indication that the design was entirely solo or entirely social. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the application's design as having a sequential interface where users move through each step of the creation process sequentially using buttons at the bottom of the screen. This suggests that the application is not entirely turn-based or simultaneous, but rather has a mix of both. Some actions can be taken at any time, while others are taken in a specific order. This design allows for flexibility and ease of use, as users can move through the process at their own pace and explore different options without feeling constrained by a strict turn-based system."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the design of the application being studied is an equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances. This is because the participants mentioned getting better at using the application over time, which suggests that there is some level of repetition or consistency in their use of the application. Additionally, the passage mentions preparing resources or creating exercise material according to each child's interests, which implies that the application has a dynamic and adaptive nature that can respond to the user's needs in real-time. However, the passage also notes that sharing AR experiences through an online portal is more complex and requires further thought, which suggests that there may be some asynchronous aspects to the design. Overall, the mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances in the design seems to be balanced and tailored to the needs of the users."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves designing an application for children with autism to interact with 3D objects in augmented reality. While the initial application was designed with a simple card game mechanic, participants agreed that having more options or a broader range of 3D models would be helpful. This suggests that the design is not entirely competitive (option 1) or entirely collaborative (option 5), but rather a mix of both (option 3). The application allows for both individual and group interaction, with participants working together to complete tasks while also competing against each other."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study design described in the passage involves creating an application for children with autism to enhance their symbolic knowledge through play. The SLPs (speech-language pathologists) working with these children often center therapy around play, and the children are familiar with numerous toys present at the clinic. This suggests that the design of the application is intended to be flexible and adaptable to different scenarios and use cases, rather than being strictly symmetrical or asymmetrical. The passage also mentions that the SLPs envisioned their students \"running with it\" and coming up with something more creative than a game idea provided by the researchers, which further suggests that the design should be able to accommodate a range of user inputs and preferences."

    "question": "How would you classify the experiential play value? Do not add additional context or reasoning in your response: \n    sensority (i.e. kaleidoscope, experiencing art), \n    fantasy (i.e. role-playing), \n    construction (i.e. music, painting, building), \n    challenge (testing physical or mental abilities against others or self), \n    undisclosed/unknown, but the paper does include a game/play system or experience, \n    not applicable",
    "answer": "Construction.",
    "reasoning": "The paper describes the application as allowing participants to create and customize picture-based AR experiences from scratch using their own images and virtual content. This suggests that the application is focused on creative expression and construction, rather than other types of experiential play values such as fantasy or sensority. Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a game/play system or experience in the design process, which further supports the classification of the experiential play value as construction."

    "answer": "Semi-structured interview and Contextual Inquiry.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that the interviews conducted at the end of the diary study were semi-structured, as they had a predetermined format but allowed for some flexibility in the questions asked. The use of a short Qualtrics survey to collect written feedback during the diary study also suggests that this methodology was used. Additionally, the passage mentions that the interviews were either audio or audio/video recorded based on the participants' preferences, which is a characteristic of contextual inquiry. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are applicable to the interview methodologies used in this study."

    "reasoning": "The passage mentions that a member of the research team \"frst transcribed the data, generated initial codes, gathered data/quotes pertaining to each code, collated them into themes, discussed the themes with other members of the research team, and then reviewed and refned them.\" This process involves using autoethnography and ethnography methods to analyze the qualitative data collected from participants. Autoethnography is a method that involves reflecting on one's own experiences as a way of understanding a particular culture or social group, while ethnography is a broader term that refers to the study of people and cultures through observation and participation. In this case, both methods were used in combination to analyze the data collected from participants using the picture-based AR application."
