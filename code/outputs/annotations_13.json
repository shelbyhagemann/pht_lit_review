    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study design involves a combination of entertainment and practicality in mind. The use of a webcam to track the user's face and map it directly onto a piano keyboard is an enjoyable and interactive experience for the user. However, the primary goal of the study is to create a musical instrument that can be used by people with limited mobility, which suggests that utility was also a priority in the design. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves users playing music using a novel musical instrument called the Flote, which is designed to be played by moving the head and reacting to the sounds produced. The users are not limited to following strict rules or structures when playing the instrument, but rather have the freedom to create and improvise within a flexible framework. This suggests that the design of the Flote falls under the category of (3) flexible structure with rules, as it allows for creative expression while still providing a structured framework for play."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the Flote as an instrument that requires extensive specialized skills to build, but also mentions that it has been simplified to maintain full expressiveness. This suggests that while there may be some level of skill required to use the Flote, there is also an element of chance or randomness involved in its operation. For example, the user may need to have some level of musical training or understanding to produce certain sounds or effects, but the actual notes played and the overall sound of the instrument could also be influenced by chance factors such as the positioning of the user's body or the random fluctuations of an electronic circuit. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a musical instrument, called \"The Flote,\" which is intended for people with limited mobility. The instrument is designed to provide both solo and social affordances, allowing users to play music independently or in collaboration with others. The study emphasizes the importance of considering human factors and user experience in the design process, highlighting the need for an instrument that can be played by individuals with a range of abilities and mobility levels.

    "answer": "(3) Turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The design of the Flote system described in the study allows players to take turns, but also provides the ability for some actions to be taken at any time during the game. For example, the player can move into position to prepare for the next note while still playing the current note, and the larger note indicator will remain static, reflecting the current pitch output. This suggests that the game is not entirely turn-based, as players have some flexibility in when they can take actions. However, there are still phases of the game where turns are taken, such as when the player is moving into position to prepare for the next note. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the Flote system described in the study."

    "answer": "(3) Equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design as allowing users to move their body in a comfortable range of movement, either on a vertical or horizontal axis, and mapping the range of linear movement onto the scale of playable notes. This suggests that the system is designed to allow for both synchronous and asynchronous interactions, with the user able to move into position to prepare for the next note while still playing the current one. The use of breath control to increase expressiveness also suggests a mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a musical instrument, called Flote, that is designed for people with limited mobility. The instrument is designed to be both competitive and collaborative, allowing multiple users to play together while also having the ability to compete against each other. The study mentions that the instrument is capable of mapping the range of linear movement onto a scale of playable notes, indicating that the design is not solely focused on collaboration or competition, but rather a mix of both."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The design of the Flote is described as having a comfortable range of movement on both the vertical and horizontal axes, and the range of playable notes is the same for all users regardless of their individual range of motion. This suggests that while there may be some symmetry in the design (e.g., the key being set to C major), there are also elements that are unique to each user's abilities and can vary greatly depending on their individual input. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design in the study."
