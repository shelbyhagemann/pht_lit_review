    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) totally fun first (i.e., Entertainment game reappropriated), \n    (2) mostly fun first (i.e., design workshop with disabled stakeholders),\n    (3) both fun and utility first (i.e., design workshop with diverse stakeholders), \n    (4) mostly utility first (i.e., primary utilitarian mechanic designed first),\n    (5) totally utility first (i.e., made by clinicians or specialists, fun incorporated later)",
    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first.",
    "reasoning": "The study found that the design for BPSP involved both fun and utility aspects. The participants were involved in a design workshop with diverse stakeholders, including disabled individuals, which suggests that the design was not solely focused on entertainment but also considered practicality and functionality. The interdependence of these interactions and the validation of contributions from all stakeholders indicate that the design was designed to be both fun and useful for everyone involved."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) unstructured play (i.e., no rules, making art),\n    (2) semi-structured play (i.e., playground activities),\n    (3) flexible structure with rules (i.e., improv),\n    (4) flexible game (i.e., board game with house rules),\n    (5) game with rigid rules (i.e., video game)",
    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules.",
    "reasoning": "The study by Hammitt [31] focuses on outdoor recreation and the multi-phase experience of leisure activities. While the C&K model [19] proposes a linear progression through phases, the study by Harada et al. [32] acknowledges that leisure experiences can be structured or unstructured, with varying degrees of structure. The framework developed in the study considers the perspective of BPSP (Breadth, Depth, Pace, and Spontaneity) to overcome the limitations of the C&K model."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based.",
    "reasoning": "The study focused on the design of leisure experiences, particularly in the context of nature. The authors used a thematic analysis approach to generate themes from open-ended survey questions, interviews, and focus group data. They identified four major stages of leisure experience: planning, accessing, engaging, and sharing and recollection. Within these stages, they found that technology use was a significant factor in enhancing the leisure experience. However, they also noted that the use of technology should be balanced with the need for skill-based and chance-based elements to create an equitable and enjoyable experience for all participants. This suggests that the design should aim to provide a mix of both skill-based and chance-based elements, rather than relying solely on one or the other. Therefore, option (3) equally skill and chance-based best applies to the design in the study."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design of a recreational activity as involving phases with set durations and timings, but also allowing for some flexibility in terms of when actions can be taken. For example, participants were given the freedom to choose their own path layout and terrain type in the park, and some participants adapted their long cane techniques to navigate irregular terrain while hiking. This suggests that the design allows for some degree of player agency and decision-making, but also has set phases and timings that must be followed. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "question": "Please answer this question with a number--which of the following best apply to the design in the study: \n    (1) entirely synchronous (i.e., real time strategy game),\n    (2) mostly synchronous with a few asynchronous affordances (i.e., league of legends),\n    (3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances (i.e., helldivers 2),\n    (4) mostly asynchronous with few synchronous affordances (i.e. cookie clicker),\n    (5) entirely asynchronous (i.e., chess by postage mail)",
    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design as involving \"planning, executing, and reminiscing about leisure experiences,\" which suggests a mix of synchronous and asynchronous activities. The use of technology is also mentioned to enhance the experience of visitors by enabling interaction, exploration, and engagement with nature, which implies a design that allows for both real-time and offline interactions. Additionally, the study cites several sources that mention the importance of anticipation in recreational experiences, which suggests that the design should allow for some degree of asynchronous affordances. Overall, the design described in the study appears to have an equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative.",
    "reasoning": "The study involved designing a leisure experience for blind and visually impaired individuals, which involved gathering detailed information to understand the environment and collaborating with their companions. While there were elements of competition (e.g., planning a leisure experience), there were also opportunities for collaboration (e.g., validating each other's contributions) throughout the process. Therefore, the design was a mix of competitive and collaborative elements."
