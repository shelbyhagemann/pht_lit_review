    "answer": "I would rate this game as a 3, slightly leaning towards a 4. While it involves players acting as de facto team managers and being scored based on their collective team's performance, it is still primarily a solo activity where users make decisions and manage their teams without direct social interaction. However, there may be some indirect social interaction through communication with other users in the fantasy sports league, such as discussing player statistics or trades."

  {
    "answer": "I would rate the game as a 3, slightly asymmetrical. While there are some positive and negative valence data points, such as rushing yards and interceptions thrown, respectively, the game is not heavily skewed towards one side or the other. The data is relatively balanced, with a mix of both positive and negative valence points. Therefore, I would classify it as slightly asymmetrical, but not heavily so."

  {
    "answer": "I would classify the experiential play value as \"fantasy\" based on the context provided in the paper. The authors describe the system as an \"auditory display\" and mention that it is used for \"Fantasy Football,\" which suggests that it is intended to be a game-like experience for users. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of different player statistics and how they are displayed auditorily, which further supports the classification of this value as \"fantasy.\""
