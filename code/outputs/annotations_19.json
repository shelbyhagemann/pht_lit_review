    "answer": "(3) Both fun and utility first",
    "reasoning": "The study design in the article is a mix of both fun and utility elements. The authors sought to learn from the lived experiences of families with children with visual impairments and wanted to understand how they overcome challenges relating to game accessibility and educational activities. To achieve this, they joined an online group for parents of children with VIs, posted an online survey, and tested their second prototype at a science and technology event for children and their families in a Midwestern city. This suggests that the design was intended to be both fun and useful for its intended audience, rather than just one or the other."

    "answer": "(3) flexible structure with rules",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involved testing a user interface for visually impaired children to play Minecraft. The participants were sighted children who played the game either on their own or with a partner, and they filled out a short questionnaire afterward. Based on the description of the test, it seems that the design of the study was more flexible in terms of rules and structure, allowing for creativity and improvisation within a set of guidelines. The use of the term \"creative mode\" also suggests a more open-ended and unstructured play experience, rather than a rigidly structured game with strict rules. Therefore, option (3) best applies to the design of the study."

    "answer": "(3) equally skill and chance-based",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves designing a game for families to play together, with the goal of promoting positive interactions and bonding. The authors note that the game should be \"equally skill and chance-based,\" indicating that both luck and player skill will play a role in determining the outcome of the game. This is consistent with games like Catan, which involve a mix of strategic decision-making and random event outcomes. In contrast, games like Mario Kart are primarily skill-based, as players must develop and practice their driving skills to perform well. Games like Uno are mostly chance-based, as the outcome of each turn is largely determined by the drawing of cards."

    "answer": "(3) mix of solo and social affordances.",
    "reasoning": "The study involved testing the interface with sighted children who had played Minecraft, and they were asked to build in creative mode either on their own or with a partner. This suggests that the design allows for both solo and social play, as participants could choose to build alone or with a partner. Additionally, the study's focus on providing non-visual feedback and promoting collaboration between mixed ability users further supports this answer."

    "answer": "(3) turns are taken, but some actions can be taken at any time.",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design as using a 3x3 grid of vibration motors that sit along the forearm, and a Python script that polls the grid before the avatar's current position. This suggests that the game is turn-based, but with some flexibility in terms of when actions can be taken. The use of a grid and vibration motors also implies that the game is not entirely simultaneous, as players would need to take turns placing their avatars on different squares of the grid. However, the design does allow for some actions to be taken at any time, rather than being strictly tied to a specific turn structure."

    "answer": "(3) equal mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances",
    "reasoning": "The study describes the design goals for a Minecraft-based educational game, which include providing non-visual feedback regarding the Minecraft world, allowing users to build constructions in the Minecraft world using tangible objects, and promoting collaboration between mixed ability users. These goals suggest that the game is designed to be equally mix of synchronous and asynchronous affordances, as users will need to coordinate their actions in real-time to achieve these goals, but also have the flexibility to work on their constructions at their own pace. The study does not mention any specific time constraints or real-time strategy elements, which further supports this conclusion."

    "answer": "(3) mix of competitive and collaborative",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided in the passage, the design of the interface in the study is a mix of competitive and collaborative elements. The authors state that the interface should provide non-visual feedback regarding the Minecraft world, allow users to build constructions in the Minecraft world using tangible objects, and promote collaboration between mixed ability users. These features suggest that the design is not entirely competitive or entirely collaborative, but rather a mix of both. The authors also mention that participants were able to build in creative mode either on their own or with a partner, which further supports the idea that the design is a mix of competitive and collaborative elements."

    "answer": "(3) Both symmetrical and asymmetrical.",
    "reasoning": "The study described in the passage involves designing a tactile interface for Minecraft, a game that is primarily played visually, to allow blind and visually impaired players to participate. The designers aimed to create a system that would be both symmetrical (i.e., following a consistent structure or layout) and asymmetrical (i.e., with different abilities or behaviors for each player), in order to provide a balanced and enjoyable experience for all players."
